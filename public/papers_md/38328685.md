Nutrition  serves  as  the  cornerstone  of  an  athlete’s  life,  exerting  a  profound 
impact on their performance and overall well-being. To unlock their full potential, 
athletes must adhere to a well-balanced diet tailored to their specific nutritional 
needs.  This  approach  not  only  enables  them  to  achieve  optimal  performance 
levels  but  also  facilitates  efficient  recovery  and  reduces  the  risk  of  injuries.  In 
addition to maintaining a balanced diet, many athletes also embrace the use of 
nutritional  supplements  to  complement  their  dietary  intake  and  support  their 
training  goals.  These  supplements  cover  a  wide  range  of  options,  addressing 
nutrient deficiencies, enhancing recovery, promoting muscle synthesis, boosting 
energy levels, and optimizing performance in their respective sports or activities. 
The primary objective of this narrative review is to comprehensively explore the 
diverse nutritional requirements that athletes face to optimize their performance, 
recovery,  and  overall  well-being.  Through  a  thorough  literature  search  across 
databases  such  as  PubMed,  Google  Scholar,  and  Scopus,  we  aim  to  provide 
evidence-based recommendations and shed light on the optimal daily intakes of 
carbohydrates, protein, fats, micronutrients, hydration strategies, ergogenic aids, 
nutritional  supplements,  and  nutrient  timing.  Furthermore,  our  aim  is  to  dispel 
common  misconceptions  regarding  sports  nutrition,  providing  athletes  with 
accurate information and empowering them in their nutritional choices.

1 Introduction

Achieving peak physical condition and optimizing athletic performance significantly 
hinge on the role of food (1). Optimal nutrition is instrumental in supporting physical activity, 
enhancing sports performance, and facilitating post-exercise recovery. Professional athletes 
are expected to comprehensively meet their nutritional requirements by consuming foods in 
appropriate quantity and quality (2).

A properly balanced diet generally provides adequate energy to 
sustain individuals with heightened energy needs due to physical 
activity,  ensuring  a  maintained  energy  balance  in  most  cases  (3). 
However, meeting the energy needs of larger athletes with increased 
body weight and height, as well as athletes involved in demanding, 
high-volume training, can present a significant difficulty. Endurance 
athletes such as runners, swimmers, as well as those in sports like 
gymnastics,  wrestling,  and  boxing  that  use  dietary  restriction  for 
body  composition  adjustments,  often  face  a  negative  energy 
balance (3, 4).

Sports nutrition refers to the nutrients found in sports-related 
foods that enhance physical capabilities. These nutrients form the 
foundation  for  meeting  the  metabolic  requirements  of  athletes  or 
bodybuilders engaged in regular physical exercise, contributing to the 
preservation of physical health and athletic performance (5).

The nutritional needs of athletes are primarily dictated by the 
demands of their activities and the goals they set to attain peak sports 
performance and overall health (2, 5). The age of athletes is critical, 
especially adolescents whose nutritional needs tend to be higher not 
only to cover the performance demands but due to growth demands 
also.  Adhering  to  appropriate  nutritional  practices  is  crucial  as  it 
impacts nearly every bodily process, spanning from energy production 
to post-exercise recovery (6). Moreover, individual dietary choices 
may be influenced by factors such as knowledge, attitude, and the 
availability of nutrition-related information resources (7).

Dietitians need to consider various sport-specific factors when 
evaluating an athlete’s nutrition requirements and objectives. These 
factors include rules, arena size, competition timing, match frequency, 
and season length, which comprises macrocycles such as preseason, 
competition season, and off-season. Moreover, the physical attributes 
and position-specific responsibilities within the sport significantly 
impact the dietary requirements of athletes. For instance, rugby union 
forwards may require greater weight and strength compared to leaner 
and  faster  backs  (8).  Considering  these  sport-specific  variables, 
variations in physique, and distinctions in positions, individualized 
dietary  guidance  becomes  crucial  for  athletes  participating  in 
team sports.

Nutritional knowledge is a modifiable aspect that significantly 
shapes  dietary  behaviors  (9).  Athletes’  comprehension  of  sports 
nutrition can directly impact their food preferences, subsequently 
influencing  their  overall  athletic  performance  (10–12).  Therefore, 
athletes  should  seek  reliable  and  certified  sources  for  nutritional 
information, as this contributes to their understanding of nutrition 
(13,  14).  A  strategic  approach  to  enhancing  nutritional  awareness 
among athletes involves the implementation of nutrition education 
programs (15, 16), including individual nutrition counseling, group 
workshops, or online educational materials (17–19).

Guidance that assists athletes in attaining adequate energy intake, 
achieving the right balance of macronutrients and micronutrients, and 
strategically  timing  their  nutrition  to  enhance  performance  and 
recovery  contributes  to  optimizing  training  and  overall  athletic 
performance (20). A previous review (21) revealed athletes in team 
sports  frequently  fail  to  meet  the  recommended  dietary  intake 
requirements (18, 19). Athletes who do not achieve sufficient energy 
intake and lack a well-balanced diet of macronutrients may encounter 
obstacles in both training adaptations and recovery processes (20, 22).
Inadequate energy intake can have adverse effects on an athlete’s 
performance, resulting in a reduction of fat-free mass, compromised 

immune  function,  decreased  bone  mineral  density,  heightened 
susceptibility to injuries, and an elevated occurrence of symptoms 
related to overtraining (20).

The field of sports nutrition has seen the publication of numerous 
new research papers, accompanied by the release of 17 fresh consensus 
statements  and  recommendation  papers 
from  authoritative 
organizations  such  as  the  IOC,  ACSM,  and  ISSN  (2,  20,  23–25). 
However, there is a recurrent observation of suboptimal adherence to 
sports nutrition guidelines among athletes (26–28).

Achieving optimal performance in sports demands meticulous 
attention to nutrition, where athletes must strategically examine the 
timing, amount, and nutritional value of their food consumption, 
coupled  with  ensuring  sufficient  fluid  consumption.  A  synergistic 
blend  of  essential  elements  such  as  carbohydrates,  proteins,  fats, 
vitamins, and minerals plays a pivotal role, acting as the energy source, 
foundational components, and catalysts for success in the world of 
sports. This research paper endeavors to comprehensively examine 
existing  literature  on  the  nutritional  needs  of  athletes,  aiming  to 
pinpoint and elucidate the specific nutritional demands essential for 
their peak performance.

to  arrange 

their  diet  according 

Maintaining a healthy and well-balanced diet is of paramount 
importance  for  athletes  and  active 
individuals  to  optimize 
performance and overall well-being. The athlete nutrition guidelines 
under  scrutiny  in  this  manuscript  play  a  pivotal  role  in  guiding 
individuals 
to  established 
recommendations.  These  guidelines  not  only  serve  the  athletes 
themselves but also provide invaluable assistance to sports nutrition 
specialists in their work. The primary goal is to prevent disordered 
eating and eating disorders, which have become increasingly prevalent 
among  the  active  population.  As  such,  this  manuscript  seeks  to 
comprehensively  review  current  guidelines,  offering  a  clear  and 
updated overview. By doing so, it aims to empower athletes and active 
individuals to enhance their dietary practices, mitigating the risk of 
potential disordered eating.

2 Method

A narrative review was conducted over 6 months, spanning from 
November  2022  to  April  2023.  To  ensure  a  comprehensive  and 
relevant  collection  of  studies,  four  prominent  online  databases–
PubMed,  Google  Scholar,  Scopus,  and  Web  of  Science–were 
meticulously  explored.  The  search  aimed  to  encompass  a  broad 
spectrum of articles pertaining to various facets of nutrition and its 
impact on athletic performance. To facilitate an exhaustive search, a 
combination of specific search terms and keywords was employed. 
These  included  “Intake  of  Carbohydrates  for  athletes,”  “Intake  of 
Protein for athletes,” “Intake of fat for athletes,” “Vitamins,” “Minerals,” 
“Hydration,”  “Ergogenic  Aids,”  “Nutritional  Supplements,”  and 
“Nutrient Timing.” These keywords were selected to cover key areas 
of interest within the field of sports nutrition. The search strategy 
involved  using  different  combinations  of  the  aforementioned 
keywords to optimize the retrieval of pertinent literature. The review 
specifically included studies of an experimental nature, comprising 
randomized controlled trials, observational studies, case studies, and 
case reports conducted within groups of elite or semi-elite athletes. 
During the evaluation process, the authors scrutinized the articles to 
assess how well they addressed and aligned with the overall objectives

of the literature review. Only those articles deemed highly relevant 
were included in the final selection.

Additionally, low-risk supplements may be considered to meet daily 
requirements if necessary (3, 22).

3.1 Energy (Kcal) and energy availability

In sports, maintaining peak performance relies heavily on precise 
nutritional practices and optimal energy intake. This is crucial not 
only for effective recovery and fatigue prevention but also to reduce 
the risk of injuries and illnesses (29).

Energy availability (EA) is a key concept, representing the dietary 
energy available for physiological functions after subtracting exercise 
energy  expenditure.  When  there’s  an  imbalance,  resulting  in  Low 
Energy Availability (LEA), athletes may face negative consequences 
including  endocrine, 
across  various  physiological  systems, 
cardiovascular, 
and 
immune,  metabolic, 
gastrointestinal (30).

reproductive, 

Athletes  persisting  in  a  state  of  low  energy  availability  may 
experience a range of issues, from disruptions in menstrual function 
to  heightened  focus  on  food,  increased  illness  susceptibility, 
diminished mood, compromised performance, decreased libido, and 
hormonal imbalances (31).

While energy availability and energy balance seem similar, they 
differ  fundamentally.  Energy  balance  considers  all  components  of 
energy expenditure, particularly relevant in changes induced by diet 
and exercise on body weight and composition. In contrast, energy 
availability  focuses  specifically  on  exercise  energy  expenditure, 
providing a nuanced perspective on the intricate relationship between 
nutrition and athletic performance (32).

3.2 Carbohydrate

A high proportion of carbohydrates in the diet can significantly 
enhance performance during endurance and intense training. This is 
achieved  by  increasing  exogenous  carbohydrate  availability  and 
storing carbohydrates, known as glycogen, in muscles and the liver 
(33). During training, there is a gradual depletion of endogenous 
carbohydrates  due  to  energy  expenditure;  this  dependence  is 
contingent  upon  the  level  and  length  of  the  exercise.  Rapid 
carbohydrate intake after exercise replenishes carbohydrate stores 
quickly  and  enhances  the  body’s  training-induced  adaptation 
processes. Among macronutrients, carbohydrates play a particularly 
crucial role in athletic performance since they can be metabolized 
aerobically and anaerobically (34, 35). Muscle glycogen and blood 
glucose are key energy sources for active muscles. Achieving optimal 
carbohydrate intake aids recovery and optimizes glycogen stores for 
subsequent  training  sessions.  The  recommended  carbohydrate 
requirement varies with training volume and intensity. Emphasize the 
importance of incorporating foods exhibiting a glycemic index that 
extends across the spectrum from low to moderate into the meal 
plan,  including  complex  carbohydrates  (3).  Nevertheless,  during 
challenging  and  intense  training  sessions  or  when  meeting  high 
carbohydrate needs becomes difficult due to the substantial bulk and 
fiber  content  of  complex  carbohydrates,  it  is  permissible  to 
incorporate concentrated, nutrient-dense sources of carbohydrates. 

The glycemic index functions as a tool to classify carbohydrate-
containing foods according to their impact on blood glucose levels 
relative to glucose or white bread consumption (22). Its application in 
sports nutrition remains controversial, lacking clear recommendations 
for athletes. Studies indicate potential improvements in metabolism 
and  substrate  utilization  during  exercise  when  incorporating  low 
glycemic  index  carbohydrate-containing  foods  in  the  pre-exercise 
meal (22). However, these findings do not consistently translate to 
enhanced exercise performance. Notably, the influence of glycemic 
index  on  the  pre-event  meal  diminishes  when  carbohydrates  are 
consumed during exercise (22). Therefore, choosing a low glycemic 
index meal before exercise might prove beneficial when restricted 
consuming carbohydrates during physical activity.

Endurance activities of moderate to high levels of intensity, along 
with resistance-based workouts, heavily depend on carbohydrates as 
a  primary  fuel  source.  Therefore,  maintaining  essential  glycogen 
stores, around 80–100 g in the liver and 300–400 g in the muscles of 
the skeletal system, is crucial. Numerous studies confirm the limited 
nature of glycogen stores (36, 37), highlighting their pivotal role as a 
predominant fuel source for several hours during moderate engaging 
in aerobic exercise at a high level of intensity (38).

There is documented evidence that as glycogen stores decrease, it 
becomes  harder  to  maintain  a  high  pace  of  intense  exercise  (23). 
Consuming a snack or meal high in carbohydrates before exercise 
ensures optimal muscle glycogen reserves. On the other hand, low 
pre-exercise glycogen levels result in early fatigue, reduced training 
intensity,  depleted  muscle  glycogen,  impaired  muscle  contraction, 
glycogenolysis, and protein degradation (34, 39, 40).

A straightforward suggestion for maximizing internal glycogen 
reserves  in  high-performance  athletes  is  to  consume  adequate 
carbohydrates based on the intensity and duration of their training. 
Generally, the suggested daily carbohydrate intake falls within the 
range of 5–12 g/kg of body weight. This is particularly relevant for 
athletes  engaged  during  training  sessions  of  moderate  to  high 
intensity, lasting over 12 h per week; it is recommended to target the 
upper limit of this range, precisely 8 to 10 g/kg of body weight daily 
(41). When substantial muscle damage is not present, this level of 
carbohydrate intake has demonstrated effectiveness in maximizing 
glycogen  storage.  Recommendations  based  on  percentages  (for 
instance, aiming for 60–70% of your total daily caloric intake to come 
from carbohydrates) have lost favor because they fail to accurately 
prescribe the required carbohydrate amounts for athletes with elevated 
caloric intake or those following restricted energy intake (33).

It is important to highlight that athletes frequently fall short of 
meeting the recommended levels of energy and carbs. Consequently 
(42),  emphasizing  approaches  to  restore  glycogen  reserves  could 
be  essential 
in  the 
upcoming competition.

in  preparing  for  optimal  performance 

The synthesis of glycogen after exercise is closely tied to factors 
considering factors like the degree of glycogen reduction, the nature, 
duration, and intensity of the workout session (43). During the initial 
6 h following exercise, there is an increased pace of muscle glycogen 
replenishment, and consuming sufficient carbohydrates within 24 h 
after the workout can lead to full restoration of glycogen stores (44).

Current studies suggest that having a recovery meal within 2 h 
after exercise, as opposed to not eating, proves effective in enhancing

recovery (45). Despite optimal conditions, complete muscle glycogen 
resynthesis  can  extend  up  to  24 h,  prompting  studies  to  explore 
techniques  for  accelerating  the  pace  at  which  muscle  glycogen  is 
restored  (46).  Customizing  the  approach  based  on  the  degree  of 
glycogen  depletion,  an  effective  strategy  for  adequate  glycogen 
resynthesis involves ingesting 1.0 to 1.5 g of carbohydrates per kg of 
body weight per hour right after exercise and maintaining this intake 
at 30-min intervals for up to 6 h following the workout (2, 47). On the 
contrary, in instances where carbohydrate (CHO) intake is postponed 
by 2 h, studies indicate a 45% reduction in glycogen resynthesis rates 
(48).  The  absorption  of  glucose  in  the  intestines  might  serve  as  a 
constraint  on  glycogen  resynthesis,  especially  notable  when  a 
significant quantity of carbohydrates is ingested in a single bolus after 
exercise  (49).  There  is  a  proposition  that  carbohydrate  (CHO) 
supplementation administered at a rate of about 1.0 g/kg/h, given at 
consistent intervals (15 to 60-min intervals) post-exercise, is more 
efficacious than a substantial single bolus in sustaining elevated blood 
glucose  levels.  This,  consequently,  facilitates  increased  muscle 
glycogen restoration (48).

Studies  investigating  glycogen  resynthesis  rates  after  varying 
carbohydrate  consumption  post-exercise  yield  inconsistent  results 
(50).  Van  Loon  et  al.  discovered  that  increasing  post-exercise 
carbohydrate consumption–raising carbohydrate intake cyclists who 
consumed carbohydrates ranging from 0.8 to 1.2 g per kg per hour, in 
terms of body weight, at 30-min intervals exhibited increased rates of 
muscle  glycogen  synthesis  (16.6  vs.  35.4 mmol/kg  dry  weight/h) 
following  a  glycogen  depletion  cycling  trial  (43).  Current  studies 
suggest that 2-h intervals may not be the most effective for promoting 
muscle glycogen resynthesis, especially given the rapid restoration 
observed  within  the  initial  2 h  post-exercise  (43,  51).  Additional 
studies have documented higher rates of glycogen resynthesis with 
more  frequent  supplement  ingestion  compared  to  a  single  large 
bolus (52).

Variations  in  study  outcomes  may  arise  from  disparities  in 
protocols;  the  effectiveness  of  post-exercise  recovery  meals  is 
influenced by factors such as the timing and intervals of consumption, 
the subjects’ training status, and the type of carbohydrates used. Given 
these  limitations  and  variations  in  research  protocols,  the  current 
evidence indicates that an ingestion of carbohydrates ranging from 1.0 
to 1.5 grams per kilogram per hour is recommended and is sufficient 
to achieve maximal glycogen resynthesis (2, 48, 50). Further research 
is essential, especially studies investigating the prolonged impacts of 
post-exercise nourishment and simulating a typical training program.

3.2.1 Recommended daily intake of 
carbohydrates

To  estimate  athletes’  carbohydrate  needs,  a  recommended 
guideline involves ingesting 3-12 g of carbohydrate consumption per

3.3 Protein

Preserving and optimizing skeletal muscle mass are crucial goals 
for individuals with athletic aspirations, whether aiming for improved 
performance, increased muscularity, or accelerated recovery. Moreover, 
the  importance  of  skeletal  muscle  mass  extends  beyond  active 
individuals, providing direct clinical applications and benefits. This 
dynamic interplay–the balance between muscle protein synthesis and 
breakdown–is particularly crucial for aging adults, as skeletal muscle 
undergoes continuous regulation (54). The loss of muscle mass occurs 
when there is a negative balance, indicating a higher breakdown than 
synthesis, resulting in a net loss. On the flip side, the accumulation of 
muscle occurs when the rate of synthesis outpaces that of breakdown. 
The  interaction  between  physical  activity  and  dietary  elements, 
particularly concerning the consumption of protein and indispensable 
amino  acids,  is  pivotal  in  governing  both  the  construction  and 
degradation  of  muscle  proteins  (55).  Recent  findings  indicate  that 
alterations in the context of physical activity and nutritional intake have 
a  more  pronounced  effect  on  muscle  protein  synthesis  rates  (56). 
Therefore, changes in muscle protein synthesis rates are deemed the 
principal determinants of variations in muscle mass over time as a 
response to both exercise and nutritional influences (57).

Amino acids are the structural constituents of proteins, providing 
the building blocks for all tissues. For athletes, the main purpose of 
consuming protein following vigorous exercise or competitions is the 
rebuilding  and  restoration  involving  both  skeletal  muscle  and 
connective  tissues  (25).  The  amount,  timing,  and  type  of  protein 
intake all affect the extent to which muscles remodel after training. It’s 
crucial to emphasize that protein is not the primary source of fuel for 
athletes (25).

Various factors, including the quantities of overall amino acids, 
indispensable amino acids, and BCAA concentrations, impact the 
anabolic effectiveness of a protein source. Additionally, factors such as 
protein digestibility, digestion rate, and absorption kinetics are taken 
into account. In the assessment of dietary protein quality, attention is 
often  directed  toward  the  indispensable  amino  acid  composition 
offered  by  the  protein  source  concerning  human  nutritional 
requirements. Additionally, its capacity for digestion, absorption, and 
assimilation by diverse tissues throughout the body is considered (58).
Two  categories  of  protein  determine  whether  they  include 
essential  amino  acids:  complete  and  incomplete  protein  sources. 
Animal protein is considered complete as it provides a comprehensive 
source of protein, containing all the required amino acids. In contrast, 
plant-based  proteins  are  incomplete  sources  as  they  lack  some 
essential amino acids (59).

As highlighted in a comprehensive review (60), biological values 
for prevalent plant sources typically fall within the range of 56–74, 
whereas various animal sources exhibit a spectrum spanning from 77 
to 104 on theoretical scales ranging from 0 to 100 points. A similar 
discrepancy is noted regarding values of net protein utilization; plant 
sources typically fall within the range of 53–67, while animal sources 
tend to be in the range of 73–94 on a 100-point scale. The scores for 
Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid stand out as one of the 
commonly  utilized  benchmarks  for  assessing  protein  quality  (61) 
emerge as one of the most frequently employed metrics.

Casein, whey, and eggs achieve scores of 100 in their respective 
categories, serving as examples of animal protein sources, whereas 
red meat scores 92. In contrast, typical plant protein sources typically 
display Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid stands values 
below 100, typically falling within the reported range of 45–75 (60). 
Except for soy protein, which has a score of 100, other plant sources 
generally fall below this threshold. Similarly, employing the DIAAS 
approach for evaluating protein quality reveals a consistent pattern: 
animal sources often exceed 100, in contrast, the majority of plant 
sources tend to be below this threshold. When analyzing the amino 
acid  profiles  of  different  plant-based  isolates  in  comparison  to 
standard proteins derived from animal sources and specimens from 
muscles in the human skeletal system, it becomes clear that several 
sources  of  protein  derived  from  plants  do  not  contain  adequate 
quantities of specific amino acids, such as lysine and methionine 
levels  (62).  Moreover,  they  consistently  exhibit  reduced  levels  of 
indispensable  and  BCAA  in  contrast  comparing  animal  protein 
sources to the amino acid composition present in human skeletal 
muscle. Furthermore, elements such as vary depending on factors 
such  as  the  type  of  nutrient,  individual  characteristics,  and  the 
specific physiological context notably affect the nutritional quality of 
a protein. Concerning digestibility, compelling evidence suggests that 
numerous plant sources have a considerably lower digestibility rate 
(45–80%)  compared  to  diverse  animal  proteins  (>90%)  (63).  In 
essence, there is a general agreement that the transportation of amino 
acids  to  peripheral  tissues  from  plant-based  proteins  is  typically 
regarded as less efficient compared to that from animal proteins (64, 
65). These distinctions are considered critical factors that influence 
the  postprandial  protein  synthesis  response  observed 
in 
different tissues.

To promote muscle repair, remodeling, and improve post-exercise 
strength- and hypertrophy-related responses, it is crucial to ingest 
protein before, during, and after a workout (66). Consumption of 
protein during these periods has been associated with a favorable 
impact on Muscle Protein Synthesis (MPS) (67).

Prior to exercise, ingesting protein with meals within 3-4 h before 
the workout can assist in maintaining muscle growth and enhancing 
muscle recovery, especially when combined with resistance training 
(68). Combining amino acids with carbohydrates before exercise can 
lead to peak rates of MPS, although the effects of protein and amino 
acid  feedings  during  this  period  on  exercise  performance  are  not 
firmly established. However, consuming carbohydrates combined with 
protein  or  essential  amino  acids  during  endurance  and  resistance 
training can have beneficial effects, including an improved anabolic 
hormonal status, reduced muscle damage, improved muscle cross-
sectional area, and extended time to exhaustion (25).

It is important to note that protein has a limited capacity for the 
body  to  utilize  as  an  energy  source  during  activity,  whereas 

carbohydrates are the primary fuel source. Therefore, rehydration and 
intake  of  simple  carbohydrates  (glucose)  are  most  important  for 
athletes during exercise (68).

To  enhance  myofibrillar  protein  synthesis  after  exercise  and 
minimize  amino  acid  degradation,  a  nutritional  recommendation 
advises incorporating 0.31 g/kg of high-quality and quickly digestible 
protein, like whey protein. Those pursuing this objective should strive 
to integrate this amount per meal (69). A mixed meal consisting of 
carbohydrates  and  protein  after  exercise,  with  a  carbohydrate-to-
protein  ratio  of  approximately  4  to  1,  is  recommended  to  initiate 
muscle glycogen synthesis (20). Note that exercise has a sustained 
anabolic impact for at least 24 h. However, the ideal timing for protein 
ingestion depends on individual tolerance as it may diminish over 
time after activity (70).

3.3.1 The recommended daily intake of protein

Using the following recommendations in Table 2 may help the 
athlete to assess their need for protein and prevent excessive intake 
and keep them on track (74).

3.4 Fat

To achieve optimal performance, athletes need to consume an 
appropriate amount of energy not only during exercise but also during 
recovery.  Fat  oxidation  primarily  depends  on  oxygen,  while 
carbohydrate catabolism can occur with or without oxygen. It’s worth 
noting that the complete breakdown of glucose in the mitochondria, 
involving the presence of oxygen, yields more ATP (75). Consuming 
an adequate amount of fat is important, but high-fat or fat-loading 
diets are ineffective (76, 77). It is recommended to consume dietary 
fat between 20 and 35% of the total calorie intake for athletes, with 
saturated fat intake being less than 10% (76).

Athletes frequently turn to dietary supplements to boost metabolic 
capacity, delay the onset of fatigue, enhance muscle hypertrophy, and 
shorten recovery periods (76). Omega-3, a type of PUFA, acts as a 
structural  component  within  cell  membranes  of  phospholipids. 
Omega-3 plays a crucial role in the inflammatory response of the body 
(78). Among athletes, Omega-3 has been linked to the postponement 
of  onset  muscle  soreness,  enhancement  of  anaerobic  endurance 
capacity, improvement in oxygen efficiency during aerobic exercise, 
support for skeletal muscle health, and mitigation of exercise-induced 
oxidative stress (79). It is recommended to take omega-3 after or with

a high-fat meal for optimal absorption (79). The safe recommended 
dose for omega-3 is 450–900 mg/day, with a maximum recommended 
dose of up to 3 g per day (80).

Athletes  have  employed  a  dietary  strategy  of  increasing  the 
proportion of dietary fat, primarily aiming to enhance intramuscular 
triglyceride stores. The theory behind this approach suggests potential 
benefits  for  prolonged  exercise  performance  while  preserving 
glycogen stores (81). Endurance athletes, in particular, have considered 
and applied this strategy to improve their performance in prolonged 
exercises. Conversely, athletes focused on strength and power have 
given little thought to modifying fat intake in their training strategies.
Burke  and  her  research  team  delivered  compelling  results, 
revealing that a five-day regimen of adhering to a high-fat diet, where 
over 65% of total calorie intake came from fat, while concurrently 
maintaining a low carbohydrate and a daily protein consumption of 
2.5 g per kg of body weight, not only enhanced fat utilization but also 
enabled  athletes  to  effectively  partake  in  high-intensity  and  high-
volume training sessions (82).

Moreover,  sustained  enhancements  in  fat  utilization  were 
observed  even  following  the  implementation  of  a  regimen  for 
carbohydrate loading aimed at replenishing muscle glycogen levels. 
This dietary strategy suggests that a sequence of high-fat intake 
followed  by  carbohydrate  loading  might  establish  a  conducive 
environment, enabling skeletal muscle to oxidize more fat while 
maintaining sufficient muscle glycogen. Nevertheless, subsequent 
studies did not reveal improvements in exercise performance (83). 
Certainly,  there  was  a  noted  decrease  in  the  rates  of  muscle 
glycogen utilization throughout the exercise bout (84). Given the 
expectation  that  enhanced  carbohydrate  availability  is  likely  to 
enhance power generation and exercise intensity, especially during 
the  latter  phases  of  prolonged  exercise,  these  results  were 
considered counterproductive.

While there has been extensive research on the effectiveness of 
high-fat diets, there is a general agreement that opting for a higher 
critical determinant, but rather, it depends on individual factors and 
the overall dietary context, an advisable approach to enhancing sports 
performance.  In  an  extensive  review  of  the  literature,  Johnson 
provided  insights  into  how  a  high-fat  diet  affects  performance  in 
physical activities. These observations encompass (1): no definitive 
conclusions  supporting  the  idea  that  decreasing  intramuscular 
triglycerides adversely affects performance, a hypothesis intended to 
enhance performance (2); a diet rich in fats, comprising more than 
46%  of  total  calories  derived  from  fat  and  less  than  21%  from 
carbohydrates,  promotes 
through  mechanistic 
adaptations.  These  adaptations  encompass  increased  enzymes 
involved in the oxidation of fatty acids and improvements in both fatty 
acid transport and beta-oxidation; and (3) despite these mechanistic 
changes, improvements in exercise performance were not consistently 
observed, and in certain cases, a negative impact was evident (81).

fat  oxidation 

While the suggestion of increasing dietary fat intake has been 
made  for  a  positive  impact  on  the  utilization  of  substrates,  the 
prevailing consensus discourages high-fat diets due to their adverse 
effects on performance. Instances of reduced carbohydrate utilization 
and gastrointestinal discomfort further reinforce the argument against 
such dietary approaches. Whether the negative outcomes arise from 
the elevated consumption of dietary fat or the probable simultaneous 
decrease within dietary carbohydrate, the adoption of diets rich in fats 
is not recommended.

3.5 Micronutrients

Micronutrients play a crucial role in sustaining life, encompassing 
vitamins  and  minerals  that  support  well-being,  development,  and 
reproductive processes. These essential substances, required in small 
quantities, must be obtained through dietary intake as the human 
body cannot synthesize them (85).

Vitamins are categorized based on their solubility, with A, D, E, 
and K being fat-soluble, and B and C being water-soluble. Minerals, 
on  the  other  hand,  are  non-organic  compounds  contributing  to 
physiological  operations  (85).  Daily  physiological  requirements 
classify minerals, with macrominerals requiring around 100 mg per 
day and trace elements approximately 20 mg per day for individuals’ 
health (85).

While a nutritionally balanced diet generally provides essential 
micronutrients in recommended doses for regular bodily functions, 
the  appropriateness  of  these  guidelines  for  athletes  is  a  subject  of 
debate. Athletes often resort to micronutrient supplementation, with 
close to half of them incorporating vitamin or mineral supplements 
in their regimen, according to a meta-analysis (86).

Research findings indicate that, similar to the impact of exercise 
intensity,  duration,  and  character  on  macronutrient  needs,  these 
factors also influence athletes’ micronutrient requirements. In sports 
with  elevated  energy  demands,  there’s  a  likelihood  of  increased 
micronutrient  needs,  though  precise  quantification  remains 
challenging (85).

When athletes have heightened overall energy requirements due 
to their training regimen, this increased need should reflect in both 
macro- and micronutrient intake. Meeting this demand through a 
well-rounded  diet  aligned  with  recommended  dietary  reference 
intakes  for  vitamins  and  minerals  is  generally  achievable  (87). 
However, certain scenarios, such as substantial losses through sweat 
and  urine  or  specific  dietary  preferences,  may  lead  to  increased 
vitamin and mineral requirements (85).

In  instances  where  athletes  face  challenges  in  meeting  their 
micronutrient  needs  through  diet  alone,  supplementation  may 
be  beneficial.  Athletes  might  consider  external  supplements  to 
enhance  well-being  and  performance,  especially  in  situations  like 
altitude training, where iron supplementation may be necessary (88, 
89).  Specific  sports  may  present  unique  concerns,  such  as  lower 
concentrations of vitamin D for athletes in winter sports or indoor 
activities (90).

Athletes consuming a diet rich in energy from nutrient-dense 
foods  typically  do  not  require  vitamin  and  mineral  supplements. 
However, those who struggle to meet their micronutrient needs may 
benefit from supplementation, guided by a sports nutritionist (91, 92). 
It’s  crucial  to  emphasize  that  while  micronutrients  are  crucial  for 
health, they do not exert ergogenic effects, and factors like low-energy 
diets,  vegetarianism,  illness,  and  injuries  can  contribute  to 
micronutrient deficiencies (40, 93).

3.6 Hydration

It is crucial to replenish fluid loss during, before, and after exercise. 
Researchers  have  found  that  losing  2%  of  body  fluids  can  affect 
performance and cognitive function. Thirst is often not an effective 
indicator of dehydration, as 1.5 L can be lost before thirst perception 

Frontiers in Nutrition

06

frontiersin.org

Amawi et al. 

10.3389/fnut.2023.1331854

(94). Athletes are susceptible to losing 0.3 to 2.4 L per hour of sweat, 
which  includes  not  only  water  but  also  salt,  potassium,  calcium, 
magnesium,  and  chloride.  Consequently,  fluid  and  electrolyte 
replacement should be incorporated into their recovery (93).

Fluid  balance  is  fundamental  for  athletes,  as  hypohydration, 
which occurs when body water levels are lower than normal due to 
excessive  sweating  during  exercise  or  diarrhea,  can  have  life-
threatening consequences and negatively impact performance (95). 
On the other hand, during endurance exercise, increased consumption 
of mostly sodium-poor or sodium-free liquids, such as water, can lead 
to  hyponatremia  (96).  Excessive  fluid  consumption  causes  fluid 
retention  in  the  body,  resulting  in  dilutional  hyponatremia  (97). 
Athletes should be aware that the body can lose fluids in various ways 
through sweating as a natural result of prolonged exercise, urination, 
and other factors such as temperature and humidity (98).

The physical signs and symptoms of dehydration include dry and 
poor skin turgor, dark urine color, rapid weight loss, dry and sticky 
mouth, weakness, fatigue, headache, sunken eyes, muscle cramps, an 
increased rate of injuries, difficulty in recovery, and a racing heartbeat 
(99, 100). Additionally, over-hydration can manifest through physical 
signs  and  symptoms  such  as  weight  gain,  swelling  of  the  feet  and 
hands  (edema),  nausea  and  vomiting,  orthopnea  (sensation  of 
breathlessness  during  sleep),  low  blood  sugar,  weakness,  seizures, 
fatigue, headache, and increased urination (99, 100).

Athletes are advised to initiate a pre-training regimen in a well-
hydrated state, ingesting approximately 500 to 600 mL of water or a 
sports beverage 2 to 3 h before engaging in exercise. An additional 
intake of 200 to 300 mL of water or a sports drink is recommended 10 
to 20 min before the onset of exercise (101). Throughout the training 
session, fluid replenishment should align with sweat and urine losses, 
endeavoring to sustain hydration levels while minimizing body weight 
reduction to less than 2%. Typically, this goal can be met by consuming 
200 to 300 mL of fluid at intervals of 10 to 20 min. Post-activity, the 
focus of hydration should be on rectifying any fluid deficits incurred 
during the practice or competition (102).

Sports  drinks  are  primarily  used  to  rehydrate  and  replenish 
essential electrolytes and other important components for athletes, 
such as magnesium, sodium, calcium, potassium, glucose, and fluids 
lost during strenuous exercise, to enhance endurance and performance 
(103). On the other hand, the usage of sports drinks may differ based 
on the nature of the exercise. The best time to use a sports drink is 
during high-intensity and long-duration exercise lasting more than 
1 h, on hot and humid days, during heavy or salty sweating, and for 
recovery after training (104).

The beverage hydration index model was introduced to evaluate 
the  hydrating  potential  of  a  drink  compared  to  plain  water  when 
individuals are at rest. This model operates on the assumption that a 
beverage inducing greater diuresis than water results in less retained 
available fluid in the total body water pool, reflected by a beverage 
hydration index below 1.0. Although a recent addition to beverage 
metrics, akin to the glycemic index for foods, the beverage hydration 
index has garnered replication by various research groups (105–107) 
since its inception (108). Significantly, population-specific factors like 
body  mass  and  sex  seem  to  have  negligible  effects,  and  the 
reproducibility of the hydration index model is reported to be robust 
(105).  Consequently,  the  hydration  index  model  has  gained 
recognition as a reliable method for evaluating beverage hydration 
characteristics  in  well-controlled  conditions,  particularly  when 

individuals are in a state of dehydration, as opposed to rehydration 
scenarios following exercise.

The  addition  of  electrolytes  to  water  seems  to  enhance  fluid 
retention according to the beverage hydration index method (105, 
109). Nevertheless, the minimum sodium level required to achieve 
this effect varies across studies, as some indicate that sports drinks 
with  approximately  20 mmol  sodium  may  not  necessarily  yield  a 
significantly greater hydration index compared to the water control 
(106,  108).  This  aspect  warrants  further  exploration,  especially 
considering  that  sports  drinks  are  commonly  recommended  for 
general public use as a suitable beverage for oral rehydration post-
dehydration. Beverages with elevated sodium content (usually around 
45 mmol), like Pedialyte, tend to exhibit a higher hydration index 
compared  to  water.  However,  whether  Pedialyte  has  a  hydration 
index superior to a sports drink remains uncertain in some studies 
(105, 107, 108). This aspect requires further investigation, especially 
considering that sports drinks are often recommended for general 
public  use  as  a  suitable  beverage  for  oral  rehydration  after 
dehydration. Beverages with higher sodium content (typically around 
45 mmol), such as Pedialyte, generally show a higher hydration index 
compared  to  water.  However,  whether  Pedialyte  has  a  hydration 
index superior to a sports drink remains uncertain in some studies 
(107, 108).

3.7 Ergogenic aids and nutritional 
supplements

In recent times, there has been a significant increase in attention 
devoted  to  nutritional  supplements  and  ergogenic  aids  within  the 
sports  community.  Nutritional  supplements  are  concentrated 
reservoirs of nutrients or other compounds exhibiting nutritional or 
physiological qualities beyond what is naturally obtained through a 
regular  diet  (110).  Ergogenic  aids  pertain  to  pharmaceutical 
substances employed to boost sports performance (111). Recognizing 
a profitable market, commercial brands cater to high-performance 
athletes (112), university students (113), and young amateur athletes 
(114) who enthusiastically supplement their diets with these products. 
The growing prevalence of athletes using nutritional supplements and 
ergogenic  aids  has  raised  concerns  among  health  and  sports 
authorities. A significant number of these supplements and aids have 
been found to be contaminated with harmful or banned substances 
(115). Such contamination could pose a risk to the health of athletes 
or lead to competition bans if the products contain prohibited doping 
substances (116). While the utilization of nutritional supplements and 
ergogenic aids is common among athletes ranging from recreational 
to  elite  levels,  only  a  select  few  ergogenic  aids  (such  as  creatine, 
sodium bicarbonate, and caffeine) have been proven to enhance sports 
performance (117).

Dietary  supplements  play  a  crucial  role  in  building  muscle, 
boosting the immune system, and providing fuel to enhance training 
or  athletic  performance.  Elite  athletes  often  utilize  performance-
enhancing  agents,  with  many  considering  supplements  to  be  an 
essential  component  for  sports  success  (118).  A  Canadian  study 
revealed that 87% of elite male and female athletes used supplements 
regularly (112), while another study conducted in Canada found that 
98% of young athletes between the ages of 11 and 25 used supplements 
on a regular or intermittent basis (119). In this section, we will discuss

the effectiveness of the most widely used supplements for improving 
physical performance.

performance,  while  high  doses  (≥  9 mg/kg)  do  not  show  any 
additional benefits (80).

3.7.1 Creatine

Creatine stands out as the most frequently used and scientifically 
backed ergogenic aid (120, 121). It holds a preferred status over other 
ergogenic aids due to its proven ability to increase power, enhance 
muscular  strength,  and  promote  an  increase  in  fat-free  mass, 
ultimately improving exercise and sports performance (121).

Recent studies highlight that creatine supplementation, with doses 
ranging from 0.3 g per kg per day for 3 to 5 days or 20 g per day for 5 
to  7 days  without  interruption,  results  in  a  rapid  increase  in 
intramuscular  creatine,  providing  ergogenic  advantages  (122). 
Additionally,  creatine  supplements  have  been  shown  to  accelerate 
recovery from injury and muscle damage (122, 123). Notably, a study 
demonstrated that introducing a preload at 0.3 g/kg body weight and 
a post-maintenance protocol at 0.1 g/kg body weight after a vigorous 
eccentric resistance training session in young men led to reduced 
muscle damage and strength loss (124). Another study documented a 
substantial reduction in oxidative stress and an increase in athletic 
performance  in  male  athletes  who  took  creatine  monohydrate 
(20 g/day)  after  7 days  (125).  Previous  research  also  suggests  that 
creatine  supplements  can  mitigate  muscle  damage  resulting  from 
prolonged, intense exercise sessions.

Studies  on  creatine  supplements  consistently  show  enhanced 
performance  and  increased  strength  in  short-duration,  maximal-
intensity exercises, as evidenced by improvements in metrics such as 
single-repetition maximum, muscular strength, repetitions, muscular 
endurance, speed, and overall strength (126, 127). A meta-analysis 
examining the impact of creatine supplementation on upper and lower 
extremity performance revealed a noticeable increase in strength for 
both  extremities  (128).  Notably,  performance  improvement  was 
observed  in  individuals  following  a  creatine  supplementation 
program, particularly in conjunction with resistance training. This 
effect was particularly pronounced in individuals without a history of 
prior  training,  defined  as  those  engaging  in  exercise  less  than  3 h 
per week.

Currently, the scientific literature strongly supports the utilization 
of  creatine  supplementation  for  boosting  performance  in  short-
duration, high-intensity resistance training, demonstrating a distinct 
influence on lean body mass. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether 
these  effects  of  creatine  supplementation  translate  into  enhanced 
athletic performance.

3.7.2 Caffeine

Caffeine, a natural derivative stimulant, is associated with several 
proposed  ergogenic  effects.  Known  for  its  stimulating  properties, 
caffeine not only improves performance but also increases the release 
of neurotransmitters, enhances intellectual ability, and boosts energy 
expenditure (129). Studies indicate that caffeine serves as a potent 
ergogenic aid for both aerobic and anaerobic training, particularly 
benefiting endurance activities like cycling and running (71).

Research suggests that consuming 2-5 mg/kg of caffeine before 
engaging in performance-based activities can significantly enhance 
sports  performance  (130).  Another  study  demonstrated  an 
approximate 3.2% improvement in athletic performance with similar 
doses of caffeine (131). It has been observed that moderate doses of 
caffeine, ranging from 3 to 6 mg/kg, are effective in improving sports 

Several  proposed  mechanisms  aim  to  explain  the  impact  of 
caffeine  supplements  on  athletic  performance,  focusing  on  their 
effects  on  endurance,  muscle  contraction,  and  perceived  exertion 
(132, 133). The primary mechanism involves caffeine’s action within 
the central nervous system, where it competes with adenosine for its 
receptors,  mitigating 
the  adverse  effects  of  adenosine  on 
neurotransmission, arousal, and pain perception (134). Additionally, 
the analgesic effect of caffeine reduces the perception of pain and 
effort during exercise, potentially serving as an additional mechanism, 
especially in exercises inducing discomfort (132, 133). Consequently, 
reduced pain perception may contribute to sustained or increased 
motor unit firing rates, facilitating greater force production (133, 135).
The  recommended  dosage  of  2-5 mg/kg  aligns  with  existing 
literature, emphasizing the importance of optimal caffeine intake for 
maximizing benefits. The observation that high doses do not yield 
additional  advantages  suggests  a  dose–response  relationship, 
emphasizing the need for moderation in caffeine consumption.

3.7.3 Protein and amino acid supplements

Amino acid supplements enjoy widespread popularity and are 
commonly utilized by highly-trained athletes. Beyond the realm of 
sports,  amino  acids  offer  potential  therapeutic  benefits,  such  as 
promoting healing, enhancing the immune system, preventing muscle 
atrophy  in  both  the  elderly  and  malnourished  individuals,  and 
contributing to the treatment of kidney and liver diseases (136).

Critical for maintaining a positive nitrogen balance in the body, 
amino acid supplements, including branched-chain amino acids and 
protein powder, play an essential role (71). Approved by the FDA to 
counteract nitrogen loss, protein supplements are recognized as safe 
when  used  in  accordance  with  good  manufacturing  or  feeding 
practices (REF) (80).

3.7.4 Whey protein

Following resistance training, incorporating whey supplements 
may contribute to enhanced muscle building. In a study, participants 
who consumed a 20 g whey supplement before and after resistance 
exercise exhibited greater gains in muscle mass and strength over a 
10-week period compared to those who took a placebo (137). Another 
investigation revealed that athletes who consumed a whey supplement 
before and after a training session achieved the ability to perform 
more repetitions and lift heavier weights 24 and 48 h after the exercise, 
respectively (138).

It  is  crucial  to  emphasize  that  immediately  after  resistance 
training, the consumption of a high-quality protein source promotes 
muscle growth and aids in recovery (139). While whey supplements 
may be preferred over casein or soy in the immediate post-exercise 
period due to their faster absorption, there is no evidence suggesting 
that they result in greater muscle growth over a 24-h period (140). 
Additionally, whey protein has been associated with potential immune 
system benefits. Participants taking whey supplements experienced a 
smaller drop in glutathione levels, linked to lower immunity, after a 
40-kilometer cycling time trial (141).

After intense exercise, additional protein is necessary to build new 
muscle  proteins  and  repair  damaged  muscle  cells  (137).  Current 
recommendations from scientists suggest athletes should consume 
between 1.3 and 1.8 g of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. 

Frontiers in Nutrition

08

frontiersin.org

Amawi et al. 

10.3389/fnut.2023.1331854

The precise amount of protein required for muscle building has been 
a  subject  of  debate,  with  strength  and  power  athletes  tending  to 
consume at the higher end of this range (1.6–1.8 g) (103).

The study’s results support the idea that the timing and type of 
protein intake can influence post-exercise outcomes. While the faster 
absorption of whey is advantageous immediately after training, the 
overall 24-h impact on muscle growth appears comparable to other 
high-quality protein sources. Athletes can strategically incorporate 
whey  protein  into  their  post-exercise  nutrition,  recognizing  its 
advantages while ensuring a balanced overall protein intake.

3.7.5 Branched-chain amino acid

The best way to describe branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) is 
as a combination of three out of the nine essential amino acids. Valine, 
leucine, and isoleucine, the three BCAAs, cannot be synthesized by 
the body on its own (142). These amino acids collectively constitute 
one-third of muscle proteins and play a pivotal role in the metabolism 
of skeletal muscle due to their distinctive properties (143). BCAAs 
facilitate the absorption of blood sugar by muscle fibers and influence 
insulin signaling (143). Notably, leucine is of particular importance 
among the three BCAAs, serving a crucial role in regulating muscle 
protein  synthesis  (MPS)  and  acting  as  a  modulator  even  in  the 
presence of hyperaminoacidemia (144).

Additionally,  BCAA  supplements  operate  through  various 
mechanisms,  including  reducing  soreness  and  preventing  muscle 
tissue breakdown during resistance and intense training (145). They 
contribute  to  the  reduction  of  central  fatigue,  promote  muscle 
function recovery, and maximize the MPS response (145).

According to some studies, incorporating BCAAs before and after 
exercise may effectively prevent exercise-induced muscle damage and 
increase muscle protein synthesis (146). There is evidence suggesting 
that taking BCAA supplements before resistance training can also 
reduce  delayed-onset  muscle  soreness  and  assist  athletes  in 
maintaining muscle mass during dieting (147).

However, it seems that endurance athletes may not significantly 
benefit from BCAA supplementation. A study conducted at Florida 
State  University  indicated  that  while  taking  a  BCAA  supplement 
before  and  during  prolonged  endurance  exercise  reduced  muscle 
damage, similar effects were achieved by consuming a sports drink 
with  carbohydrates  (146).  Another  study  involving  long-distance 
runners found that, compared to a placebo, BCAA supplements taken 
7 days prior to a marathon did not improve performance or reduce 
muscle  damage  (148).  In  essence,  BCAAs  do  not  appear  to  offer 
significant performance advantages during endurance exercises.

BCAAs, with a particular emphasis on leucine, play a crucial role 
in muscle protein synthesis and various aspects of muscle metabolism. 
The  documented  advantages  of  BCAA  supplementation,  such  as 
reducing  soreness,  preventing  muscle  tissue  breakdown,  and 
enhancing  recovery,  align  with  their  well-established  role  in 
supporting muscle function. While BCAAs demonstrate potential 
benefits in situations like resistance training and muscle preservation 
during dieting, their advantages may not be notably pronounced in 
the context of endurance exercises.

3.7.6 Arginine

L-arginine, a non-essential amino acid naturally produced in the 
body,  is  commonly  known  by  names  such  as  arginine  alpha-
ketoglutarate (A-AKG) and arginine ketoisocaproate (A-KIC) (80). 

Numerous studies suggest that the performance of elite athletes during 
anaerobic exercise remains largely unaffected by arginine supplements 
(149). In a study focused on A-AKG supplements, athletes did not 
exhibit  differences  in  nitric  oxide  (NO)  levels,  blood  flow,  or 
performance (150). However, a review of multiple studies indicated 
that  arginine  supplements  might  offer  a  modest  benefit  to  novice 
athletes but not to more experienced athletes or female athletes (151). 
The recommended safe dose for arginine is up to 20 g per day (80).

While  arginine  is  a  naturally  occurring  amino  acid,  its 
supplementation  seems  to  have  a  limited  impact  on  elite  athletes 
during  anaerobic  exercise,  as  suggested  by  several  studies.  The 
potential modest benefit for novice athletes, highlighted in a review, 
prompts further investigation into factors such as experience level and 
gender 
the  effectiveness  of  arginine 
supplementation. The  specified  safe  dose  serves  as  a  reference  for 
individuals  considering 
their 
nutritional regimen.

3.7.7 Beta-alanine

Beta-alanine, a non-essential amino acid naturally produced in 
the body, increases muscle carnosine concentrations when taken as a 
supplement (152). Elevated muscle carnosine levels enhance buffering 
capacity, reducing lactic acid buildup during high-intensity exercise, 
which can improve performance in sprints and short distances by 
mitigating fatigue (153).

A  systematic  review  of  19  randomized  controlled  studies  has 
confirmed that beta-alanine supplements enhance performance in 
short, high-intensity activities (154). Analyzing 15 studies revealed an 
average  performance  improvement  of  2.85%,  translating  to  a  6-s 
enhancement over a 4-min event (155). Notably, runners who took 
beta-alanine  supplements  for  28 days  in  an  Australian  study 
significantly  improved  their  800-meter  race  times  (156).  In  a 
United Kingdom study, amateur boxers receiving 6 g of beta-alanine 
per day for 4 weeks experienced a 20-fold increase in punch force and 
a four-fold increase in punch frequency (80). Many studies utilize 
daily doses of 3.2–6.4 g for six to 10 weeks (157). However, optimal 
results seem achievable with approximately 3 g (4 × 800 mg) per day 
for 6 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of 1.2 g per day (156).

Beta-alanine  supplementation  has  demonstrated  efficacy  in 
enhancing  performance  in  short,  high-intensity  activities  through 
increased muscle carnosine levels. The systematic review and specific 
studies  provide  robust  evidence  of  its  positive  impact  on  various 
athletic parameters. The recommended dosage strategy underscores 
the significance of both the initial loading phase and the subsequent 
maintenance  dose  for  optimal  results.  Athletes  and  individuals 
involved  in  high-intensity  activities  may  consider  beta-alanine 
supplementation  as  part  of  their  performance  enhancement 
strategy (158).

In summary, sports supplements lack systematic regulation, and 
there is no guarantee that they fulfill their claims or do not contain 
including 
prohibited  substances.  Major  sports  organizations, 
United  Kingdom  Sport,  the  US  National  Collegiate  Athletic 
Association, and the International Olympic Committee (IOC), have 
policies advising against the use of sports supplements (159). It is 
recommended  to  prioritize  a  healthy  diet  and  consult  with  your 
medical  team  or  sports  nutritionist  before  considering  any 
supplements (160). Further research is essential to comprehend the 
combined effects of various sports supplement intake.

3.8 Nutrient timing

Nutrient timing involves strategically providing the appropriate 
macronutrients  when  the  body  is  most  primed  to  utilize  them 
effectively  (161).  In  the  context  of  exercise,  nutrient  timing  can 
be segmented into three distinct phases: the energy phase, the anabolic 
phase, and the adaptation phase.

The energy phase encompasses the period right before and during 
the  exercise  itself.  Following  exercise,  the  anabolic  phase  occurs 
immediately and typically spans about 60 to 90 min. This period, often 
referred 
the  anabolic  or  metabolic  window  (161), 
highlights  the  heightened  responsiveness  of  exercised  muscles  to 
nutrient intervention.

to  as 

Subsequent to the anabolic phase, the adaptation phase unfolds. 
Consistently incorporating suitable supplements and meals during 
this period sustains an improved response to nutrient intervention for 
an extended duration. This fosters quicker recovery and facilitates 
training adaptation, enhancing overall exercise performance.

3.8.1 Pre-exercise nutrition

The recommended timeframe for pre-exercise nutrition typically 
extends to the hour leading up to a training session, although some 
research has investigated the impact of consuming nutrients up to 4 h 
before engaging in physical activity (162). During this period, the 
primary objective of nutrient consumption is to ensure an adequate 
fuel reserve for the muscles, thereby enhancing performance during 
the exercise.

Explorations into pre-exercise nutrition trace back to the 1930s, 
when researchers began investigating physiological reactions during 
exercise  in  response  to  the  intake  of  pre-exercise  carbohydrates 
(CHO), such as glucose and fructose (163). As research progressed, 
studies  delved  into  manipulating  exercise  performance  through 
pre-exercise nutrition strategies.

An early study involving trained swimmers, employing different 
nutritional strategies, including supplemental cane sugar, did not 
reveal significant differences in performance (164). However, this 
study  laid  the  groundwork  for  subsequent  interventions  and 
explorations  in  the  field.  Hargreaves  et  al.  (165)  found  that 
consuming 75 g of CHO, either as glucose or fructose, 45 min before 
exercise  did  not  confer  advantages 
in  time-to-exhaustion 
performance or glycogen utilization during 75% effort of maximal 
oxygen uptake in trained cyclists compared to a placebo. Conversely, 
a  larger  carbohydrate  intake  of  312 g,  consumed  4 h  prior  to 
exercise,  enhanced  time  trial  performance  at  a  70%  effort  level 
VO2max  after  100 min  in  individuals  with  recreational  cycling 
training. However, these differences were not statistically significant 
when compared to meals with equivalent energy content comprising 
either 45 or 156 grams of carbohydrates (166).

In  a  separate  study,  significant  improvements  in  a  similar 
performance  task  were  observed  when  recreationally  trained 
individuals ingested either 1.1 or 2.2 g/kg of carbohydrates 1 h before 
exercise,  in  contrast  to  a  placebo.  Interestingly,  no  significant 
distinctions  were  noted  between  the  two  CHO  doses  (167)  (33). 
Additionally,  pre-exercise 
consumption  has 
demonstrated  an  impact  on  substrate  utilization  during  exercise, 
promoting  glucose  oxidation  over  free  fatty  acids  even  at  low-to-
moderate intensities (below 60% of maximal oxygen uptake, VO2max) 
(168) (34).

carbohydrate 

In summary, the collective influence of pre-exercise carbohydrate 
intake  on  endurance  performance  generally  appears  favorable, 
although findings across studies can be inconsistent. Interpretation of 
results should consider methodological aspects, including factors like 
the time elapsed since the last intense training session and existing 
muscle glycogen levels, which are interconnected and can influence 
the effectiveness of pre-exercise feeding.

The  significance  and  performance-enhancing  benefits  of 
pre-exercise carbohydrates may be contingent on muscle glycogen 
content before feeding. This suggests that individuals with limited rest 
between training sessions may derive greater benefits compared to 
those with extended rest periods, provided they adequately consume 
carbohydrates. While much of the research has focused on aerobic 
exercises, there is growing evidence that activities involving high-
intensity intervals, such as resistance exercise, may also experience 
advantages. These activities predominantly rely on glycolytic, fast-
twitch muscle fibers, which generate force through rapid muscular 
contractions fueled by stored phosphagens and anaerobic glycolysis, 
leading to lactate production.

Even with around 40% total glycogen depletion after high-volume 
resistance exercise, it suggests that carbohydrate availability may not 
be a limiting factor unless glycogen stores are suboptimal. Importantly, 
substantial evidence indicates that pre-exercise supplementation with 
carbohydrates can mitigate glycogen reductions, even if it does not 
notably impact blood glucose levels (169).

3.8.2 During exercise nutrition

Carbohydrate (CHO) intake during physical activity has been 
extensively  studied  since  the  1960s  (49).  It  plays  a  crucial  role  in 
mitigating the utilization of muscle and liver glycogen, especially in 
situations  involving  high  exercise  intensity,  durations  exceeding 
60 min, or shorter, supramaximal exertions (170, 171). Insufficient 
CHO in these scenarios can lead to decreased exercise intensity due 
to  a  shortage  of  efficient  fuel,  diminished  calcium  release,  and 
increased fatigue (172, 173). Inadequate carbohydrate intake during 
such  activities  may  result  in  decreased  exercise  intensity  due  to  a 
shortage of efficient fuel, diminished calcium release, and increased 
fatigue. Carbohydrate (CHO) oxidation rates from exogenous sources 
show  an  exponential  increase  in  the  initial  75–90 min  of  exercise, 
underlining the significance of commencing CHO ingestion from the 
start  and  sustaining  it  throughout  the  exercise  session  for  the 
conservation  of  muscle  and  liver  glycogen  (174).  Excessive  CHO 
intake,  on  the  other  hand,  may  lead  to  gastrointestinal  upset, 
potentially impeding performance goals. Diversifying CHO ingestion 
with different transporters can enhance CHO uptake and oxidation to 
approximately  1.5 g/min  or  90 g/h  (175).  This  varied  CHO 
consumption not only improves CHO availability without causing 
gastrointestinal upset (176) but also carries the potential to enhance 
overall performance (177). For example, a study illustrated an 8% 
increase in power output during a time trial after 120 min of steady-
state cycling when cyclists consumed beverages with a 2:1 ratio of 
glucose to fructose, as opposed to glucose alone (177). Importantly, 
fructose ingested at a rate of 1.2 g/min, when combined with an equal 
amount of glucose, leads to a higher CHO oxidation rate compared to 
lower quantities, in line with the commonly recommended 60 g/h. 
These  results  highlight  the  potential  benefits  of  integrating  varied 
carbohydrate  (CHO)  intake  to  enhance  performance  (171–174, 
176, 177).

An  alternative  approach  to  optimizing  carbohydrate  (CHO) 
delivery,  with  the  goal  of  minimizing  gastrointestinal  distress  and 
potentially boosting performance, involves the simultaneous intake of 
protein and CHO. Recent findings from a review and meta-analysis 
indicated positive performance outcomes, especially in time trials or 
efforts to exhaustion, for groups consuming a combination of CHO 
and protein compared to CHO alone (178). The noted favorable effect 
persisted  consistently,  even  with  the  utilization  of  non-isocaloric 
supplements.  However,  when  ensuring  that  CHO  and  protein 
supplements  were  equivalent  in  CHO  content  and  subsequent 
examination of the effects of isocaloric supplementation involving 
both  CHO  and  protein  or  CHO  alone  on  time  to  exhaustion,  no 
notable differences were observed (178).

Although the simultaneous ingestion of protein and carbohydrates 
may  not  yield  immediate  performance  improvements,  there  are 
indirect advantages. These encompass the capacity to boost caloric 
intake  while  reducing  carbohydrate  consumption  to  prevent 
gastrointestinal  distress,  enhancing  amino  acid  bioavailability  to 
reduce  muscle  protein  breakdown,  and  improving  amino  acid 
availability for gluconeogenesis. Moreover, co-ingestion may play a 
role in postponing central nervous system fatigue (179).

The  effectiveness  of  intra-exercise  nutrition,  especially  the 
consumption  of  carbohydrates  (CHO),  is  highly  contingent  on 
variables like pre-exercise feeding, glycogen status, and the type of 
exercise (178). For aerobic activities lasting more than 2 h, optimal 
results are achieved by consuming 90–144 g/h of CHO in a 2:1 glucose 
to fructose solution. This strategy maximizes the uptake and oxidation 
of CHO while simultaneously preserving muscle glycogen.

In  competitive  scenarios,  where  extended  endurance  events 
frequently conclude with a sprint to the finish line, relying significantly 
on anaerobic metabolism and the utilization of endogenous muscle 
glycogen, the prudent conservation of this fuel source throughout the 
entire bout becomes paramount.

3.8.3 Post-exercise nutrition

After  engaging  in  physical  activity,  individuals  commonly 
experience a temporary surge. During this phase, there is an increase 
in fatigue, muscle soreness, and a decline in performance. In this stage, 
catabolic  processes  take  precedence,  leading  to  decreased  insulin 
levels, restricted glycogen, and limited substrate availability. Cortisol 
and catecholamines collectively influence physiological processes in 
the  body,  heightening  the  pace  at  which  muscle  protein  is  being 
broken down (180).

The intake of carbohydrates and protein post-exercise offers the 
potential to raise glucose levels in the bloodstream, reduce cortisol 
levels, and improve substrate availability, enabling the transition from 
a catabolic state to a more anabolic condition (180). Additionally, 
activating muscle GLUT4 transporters, increasing glycogen synthase 
activity, and enhancing insulin sensitivity all contribute to improving 
how responsive skeletal muscles are to absorbing carbohydrates and 
amino acids (50, 181). Therefore, the post-exercise period offers a 
strategic opportunity for nutrient intake to aid in replenishing muscle 
glycogen, promoting protein synthesis, and reducing the degradation 
of muscle proteins (180, 181). Integrating the timing of nutrient intake 
after  exercising  into  a  training  routine  becomes  essential  for 
optimizing recovery rates and maximizing the benefits of training.

During  moderate-to-high  intensity  exercise,  muscle  glycogen 
assumes  a  crucial  role  as  the  primary  source  of  energy  to  sustain 

physical  activity.  In  light  of  this  situation,  precise  post-exercise 
nutrient  timing  becomes  vital,  emphasizing  the  primary  goal  of 
replenishing muscle glycogen to hasten the recovery process. After 
physical activity, there is a decrease in the heightened levels of post-
exercise glucose transporters, which are crucial for the absorption of 
nutrients. This decline brings the transporter levels back to baseline 
within a two-hour period (182).

Aside from glycogen synthesis, the consumption of protein and 
essential  amino  acids  following  exercise  plays  a  pivotal  role  in 
triggering muscle protein synthesis and aiding in the reconditioning 
of skeletal muscles (183). After exercising, there is a notable increase 
in muscle damage and protein degradation in the aftermath of exercise 
(161, 181). Moreover, when glycogen stores are depleted, the pace of 
protein  breakdown  increases,  as  amino  acids  could  potentially 
undergo  gluconeogenesis  to  be  utilized  in  replenishing  levels  of 
glycogen (91). As a result, it is crucial to consume protein after exercise 
to  mitigate  the  breakdown  of  proteins  and  assist  in  the  repair  of 
muscle damage (183).

When aiming to stimulate muscle protein synthesis, proteins that 
are  rapidly  digestible  and  of  high  quality,  containing  an  adequate 
amount of essential amino acids, may be more effective than proteins 
with lower quantities of branched-chain amino acids or those that are 
slower to digest (69).

Comprehensive training and maintaining a sufficient daily protein 
intake are crucial for achieving strength and hypertrophy. However, 
beyond these foundational aspects, there are potential advantages to 
carefully considering the timing of protein consumption, especially 
immediately  after  exercising.  The  positive  impacts  on  net  protein 
balance and glycogen synthesis underscore the significant benefits of 
ingesting protein in the post-training period.

factors  contributing 

Fundamentally,  critical 

to  optimal 
performance include not only the quality of the training but also the 
overall  protein  intake  throughout  the  day.  The  strategic  timing  of 
protein consumption provides an additional layer of support to boost 
performance. Even if the resulting benefits are seemingly minor, this 
aspect becomes a pertinent factor, particularly for competitive athletes 
who are dedicated to optimizing their performance.

In  summary,  the  significance  of  nutrient  timing  is  a  nuanced 
matter,  and  its  relevance  varies  greatly  depending  on  the  context. 
Defined as the delivery of adequate macronutrients precisely when the 
body is ready to use them (184), nutrient timing represents a dietary 
approach  where  specific  nutrients  are  ingested  before  training  to 
enhance both short-term performance and long-term adaptations (23).
Early  research  delved  into  the  effects  of  acute  carbohydrate 
(CHO) consumption on exercise performance, focusing on glycogen 
depletion and use during moderate to high-intensity aerobic activity 
(185, 186). Subsequent studies broadened the scope to investigate 
how  acute  protein  consumption  (PRO)  impacts  endurance  and 
resistance workout performance, as well as recovery and adaptation. 
Despite these inquiries, it’s noteworthy that the effects of nutrient 
timing on performance, recovery, and adaptation outcome variables 
have  only  been  explored  in  a  limited  number  of  chronic 
interventional studies.

The  time  before  exercise,  typically  within  4 h  prior,  involves 
specific dietary tactics. Glucose loading, for instance, aims to boost 
muscle glycogen reserves in the days preceding an endurance race, 
resulting  in  enhanced  glycogen  storage  levels  and  improved 
performance in activities lasting over 90 min (167, 187).

to 

Consuming 150–200 grams of carbs 4 h before exercise has shown 
to  significantly  increase  muscle  glycogen  reserves,  ultimately 
contributing 
improved  exercise  performance  (188–190). 
Additionally, it is advisable to include healthy fats in the diet 6-5 h 
before exercise. Conversely, to prevent gastrointestinal discomfort, it’s 
recommended to avoid fiber consumption 2-3 h before engaging in 
physical activity (67, 190, 191).

The energy phase during a workout is crucial as muscles require 
sufficient  energy  for  contractions.  According  to  timing  science, 
consuming carbohydrates, proteins, specific amino acids, and vitamins 
10 min before and during exercise is necessary for this objective. The 
benefits encompass a good supply of glycogen, a reduction in cortisol, 
and  assistance  in  preparing  muscle  enzymes  for  faster  recovery 
(192, 193).

Post-workout  nutrition  timing  is  widely  regarded  as  the  most 
crucial phase. Intensive resistance training sessions damage muscle 
fibers and deplete the body’s reserves of fuel, including glycogen and 
amino acids. Consuming the right balance of nutrients during this 
time initiates the healing process for injured tissue and replenishes 
energy stores. This occurs in a super-compensated manner, enhancing 
exercise performance and body composition. Researchers often refer 
to this limited timeframe following training as the “anabolic window 
of opportunity,” emphasizing its significance in maximizing muscle 
adaptations related to the training (194–196).

recommendations for addressing the nutritional needs of the active 
population, with a specific focus on preventing disordered eating. 
Given the unique challenges faced by athletes, it is imperative to tailor 
nutrition plans to individual requirements.

review  offers 

Individualization  emerges  as  a  cornerstone  in  preventing 
disordered eating among athletes. Recognizing diverse goals, body 
compositions, metabolic rates, and dietary preferences is essential. 
Tailoring nutrition plans to accommodate these individual factors can 
significantly contribute to optimizing performance while mitigating 
the risk of disordered eating (197).

Macronutrients, which include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, 
play a critical role in athletic nutrition. Adequate carbohydrate intake 
is necessary to support energy production and replenish glycogen 
stores, thereby reducing the likelihood of restrictive eating behaviors 
(33).  Proteins  are  indispensable  for  muscle  repair  and  growth, 
emphasizing  the  importance  of  meeting  increased  protein  needs 
without resorting to excessive dietary restrictions (198). Meanwhile, 
healthy fats contribute to sustained energy, hormone production, and 
overall health, promoting a balanced approach to nutrition.

In  addition  to  macronutrients,  micronutrients,  encompassing 
vitamins and minerals, are paramount for energy metabolism and 
immune function. Promoting a diverse, nutrient-dense diet is crucial 
to ensuring athletes receive adequate micronutrients, thereby reducing 
the risk of nutritional deficiencies that might contribute to disordered 
eating (199).

Hydration emerges as a key factor in preventing disordered eating 
among  the  active  population.  Proper  fluid  balance  is  essential  for 
physiological function, and athletes must be attuned to their individual 

fluid needs. Maintaining adequate hydration levels before, during, and 
after  exercise  is  crucial,  as  dehydration  can  exacerbate  disordered 
eating behaviors.

While acknowledging the interest in sports nutrition supplements, 
caution is advised. Athletes should prioritize meeting their nutritional 
needs through whole foods to minimize the risk of disordered eating 
patterns (200). Supplements should only be considered when dietary 
intake falls short or specific deficiencies are identified. Consultation 
with  qualified  professionals  is  essential  to  ensure  safe  and 
appropriate usage.

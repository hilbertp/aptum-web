Introduction:  This  investigation  aims  to  elucidate  the  impact  of  Ramadan 
intermittent fasting on performance, physiological responses, and bioenergetic 
pathway contributions during repeated sprints.

Methods:  Fourteen  active  male  Muslim  athletes  (age  =  22.4  ±  1.8  years,  body 
weight  =  69.5  ±  3.8  kg, height  =  176  ±  5.1  cm) executed a repeated sprint protocol, 
consisting of ten 20-meter sprints with 15-s passive recovery intervals, during 
both  fasting  and  non-fasting  conditions.  The  fasting  session  was  conducted 
after  a  12–14  h  fast  following  Sahur  (the  pre-dawn  meal  during  Ramadan).  In 
contrast, the non-fasting session occurred before the Ramadan fasting period 
began,  during  the  same  hours  of  the  day,  at  a  time  when  fasting  was  not  yet 
required for the athletes. Bioenergetic pathway contributions during repeated 
sprints were quantified using the PCr-LA-O2 method.

Results: The mean sprint time during fasting sessions was 3.4  ±  0.3  s compared to 
3.3  ±  0.2  s in non-fasting sessions, indicating a trend approaching the threshold of 
significance for slower times in the fasted state (p  =  0.052, effect size (ES)  =  0.34). 
In terms of bioenergetic contributions, the total metabolic energy expenditure 
(TEE)  was  slightly  lower  during  fasting  sessions  (236.5  ±  22  kJ)  compared  to 
non-fasting  sessions  (245.2  ±  21.7  kJ),  but  this  difference  was  not  statistically 
significant  (p  =  0.102,  ES  =  0.40).  Similarly,  metabolic  energy  expenditure  per 
sprint was 23.7  ±  2.2  kJ in fasting conditions compared to 24.5  ±  2.2  kJ in non-
fasting conditions (p  =  0.106, ES  =  0.35). The oxidative energy contribution did 
not differ significantly between fasting (34.2  ±  4.1  kJ) and non-fasting conditions 
(34.2  ±  4.1  vs.  35.5  ±  5.2  kJ;  p  =  0.238,  ES  =  0.28).  Similarly,  lactic  (60.4  ±  7.6  vs. 
59.2  ±  8.3  kJ;  p  =  0.484,  ES  =  0.15);  and  alactic  (149.3  ±  19.9  vs.  143  ±  21.5  kJ; 
p  =  0.137,  ES  =  0.30)  energy  contributions  showed  no  significant  differences 
between the fasting and non-fasting sessions. The percentage of performance 
decrement  (Pdec)  and  the  percentage  contributions  of  oxidative,  lactic,  and 
alactic  pathways  to  the  total  energy  expenditure  did  not  differ  significantly

between the fasting and non-fasting conditions, indicating a similar bioenergetic 
profile across both conditions.

Conclusion:  The  present  findings  indicate  no  significant  differences  in 
performance metrics and metabolic outcomes between fasted and non-fasted 
states. Future assessments with longer duration and higher intensity protocols 
may provide further insights.

1 Introduction

As  commonly  known,  for  religious  beliefs,  Muslim  athletes 
must  observe  fasting  from  dawn  to  dusk  during  the  month  of 
Ramadan as per the Islamic lunar calendar (1, 2). During this time, 
both  food  and  fluid  intake  are  restricted  during  daylight  hours 
leading to impaired muscle function, diminished metabolic energy 
consumption, and compromised hydration status (3–5). The daily 
fast  during  the  Ramadan  month  is  variable,  dependent  on  the 
latitude and seasonal variation, but commonly lasts 10 to 20 h daily 
across ~30 consecutive days (6). This religious observance often 
conflicts with athletes’ training schedules and competitive events, 
as mainstream sporting calendars do not accommodate religious 
practices  (1,  7).  Ramadan  intermittent  fasting  (RIF)  has  been 
shown  to  induce  alterations  in  energy  metabolism,  hormonal 
fluctuations,  and  sleep  pattern  disruptions,  which  all  could 
potentially  influence  athletic  performances  (8,  9).  Although 
current  evidence  predominantly  suggests  that  RIF  may  impair 
aerobic  rather  than  anaerobic  capacity,  there  is  a  conspicuous 
absence  of  research  examining  its  effects  on  repeated  sprint 
performance — a form of exercise that relies on both anaerobic and 
aerobic metabolic pathways (10, 11).

Although it is reported that maintaining adequate nutrition, sleep, 
and  training  can  mitigate  performance  decrements  during  fasting 
(12), prolonged fasting is also associated with an inevitable decline in 
performance,  highlighting  the  complex  interplay  between  fasting 
duration  and  athletic  outcomes  (4).  Notably,  a  significant  gap  in 
existing  research  is  the  insufficient  focus  on  energy  metabolism 
markers and other variables that could influence this process (13–15). 
Surveys among football players revealed that 39% of them abstain 
from  fasting  on  match  days  and  81.5%  believe  that  fasting  could 
impair performance (7). These findings indicate that athletes’ decisions 
to fast during training or competition are complex and multifaceted, 
deeply rooted in personal, cultural, and religious beliefs, and not solely 
based  on  empirical  evidence.  This  complexity  underscores  the 
importance of considering both the physiological and psychosocial 
dimensions of fasting in sports settings.

A  critical  lacuna  in  the  existing  literature  is  the  lack  of 
comprehensive studies examining the specific effects of Ramadan 
intermittent  fasting  (RIF)  on  repeated  sprint  activities  (RSA), 
particularly in relation to bioenergetic pathways activation. While 
RSA  is  recognized  as  a  key  performance  metric  in  many  sports, 
especially in team-based games like soccer (14, 15), its interaction 
with  the  physiological  and  bioenergetic  challenges  posed  by  RIF 

remains underexplored. Given the demanding nature of RSA (16–
18), involving high-intensity bursts of energy and rapid recovery, 
understanding how RIF influences these aspects is crucial. The lactate 
system, which reflects anaerobic metabolism, is particularly relevant 
for sports requiring high-intensity efforts, such as repeated sprints in 
soccer (10, 17, 19). During periods of intense physical exertion, the 
production  of  blood  lactate  increases  significantly,  serving  as  a 
marker  for  anaerobic  metabolism  and  a  predictor  for  athletic 
endurance and performance (20, 21). In the context of Ramadan, the 
fasting practice significantly alters metabolic responses and energy 
utilization patterns (1, 3). Fasting can lead to changes in glycogen 
stores,  impacting  lactate  production  and  clearance  (5,  22). 
Understanding  the  bioenergetic  alterations  during  Ramadan, 
particularly in terms of lactate dynamics, is crucial for comprehending 
how  fasting  affects  athletes’  performance  during  repeated  sprints 
(23). However, the impact of fasting, particularly during Ramadan, 
on these high-intensity activities is not well-documented, leaving a 
gap  in  strategies  for  athlete  preparation  and  training  during 
fasting periods.

Previous  research  has  often  attributed  the  decline  in  physical 
performance during Ramadan to factors such as caloric restriction, 
altered macronutrient composition, and sleep deprivation (2, 12, 24). 
These  elements  are  undoubtedly  significant,  yet  there  remains  a 
critical gap in understanding the specific impacts of these factors on 
athletes’ bioenergetic pathways during Ramadan. Our investigation, 
therefore, takes a novel approach by controlling for these variables and 
focusing on shifts in energy metabolism. By isolating the influence of 
energy metabolism, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of how 
Ramadan  fasting  specifically  affects  athletic  performance.  This 
approach allows us to distinguish the effects of altered nutritional and 
sleep patterns from the intrinsic metabolic changes induced by fasting. 
Our study is not just about observing performance decrements during 
Ramadan but about comprehensively understanding the underlying 
bioenergetic mechanisms. This focus on bioenergetics is crucial as it 
addresses a largely unexplored aspect of sports performance during 
Ramadan.  We  hypothesize  that  RIF  could  potentially  impair  RSA 
performance by altering bioenergetic pathway contributions, thereby 
affecting the overall energy availability and utilization during high-
intensity efforts. By investigating these dynamics, we aim to contribute 
valuable  insights  into  the  planning  and  execution  of  training  and 
competitive strategies for athletes who observe Ramadan fasting. Our 
study’s findings could also inform approaches to optimize performance 
and energy management in sports disciplines where RSA is critical, 
extending beyond soccer to other team sports.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Study design

This study utilized a quasi-experimental, crossover design with 
repeated measures to investigate the effects of RIF on RSA in active 
male Muslim athletes. The design involved assessing the same group 
of athletes under two different conditions: during Ramadan (fasting) 
and outside of Ramadan (non-fasting). The primary objective was to 
assess the impact of RIF on performance, physiological responses, and 
bioenergetic  pathway  contributions  during  RSA.  This  approach 
allowed for a direct comparison of each athlete’s performance under 
fasting and non-fasting conditions, thereby providing insights into the 
specific effects of Ramadan fasting on RSA performance.

2.2 Participants

A priori power analysis was calculated using the G*Power software 
(Version 3.1.9.4, University of Kiel, Kiel, Germany) to determine the 
required sample size with α set at 0.05 and power (1-β) set at 0.80. The 
analysis  revealed  that  a  total  sample  size  of  13  subjects  would 
be sufficient to find significant differences with an actual power of 0.82. 
Fourteen active male Muslim athletes (mean ± SD: age = 22.4 ± 1.8 years, 
body mass = 69.5 ± 3.8 kg, height = 176 ± 5.1 cm) voluntarily enrolled in 
this  study.  All  participants  were  briefed  on  the  potential  risks  and 
benefits  and  provided  informed  written  consent.  The  study  was 
conducted in accordance with the ethical principles outlined in the 
Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  received  approval  from  the  Ethics 
Committee  of  Atatürk  University’s  Faculty  of  Sport  Sciences.  The 
athletes  were  classified  as  “Trained/Developmental”  based  on  the 
Participant  Classification  Framework  by  McKay  et  al.  (25).  This 
categorization was determined by their training frequency (3–5 times 
per week) and affiliation with amateur soccer teams. These athletes 
typically  represent  a  performance  level  that  includes  structured 
training  but  not  at  the  elite  or  professional  tiers.  Inclusion  criteria 
mandated  that  participants  be  in  good  health,  free  from  acute  or 
chronic medical conditions and not undergoing any medical treatment. 
Exclusion criteria encompassed contraindications to maximal effort 
testing, existing orthopedic injuries, use of dietary supplements and 
ongoing  medical  treatment.  Participants  were  advised  to  obtain  a 
minimum of 8 h of sleep prior to each testing session and to refrain 
from  strenuous  physical  activity  during  the  study  period.  Dietary 
intake was standardized across both test days, albeit distributed across 

three  meals  during  the  control  session  and  two  meals  during  the 
fasting session. Caloric intake and macronutrient distribution were set 
at  40 kcal/kg/day,  comprising  20%  protein,  30%  fat  and  50% 
carbohydrates (2, 8).

2.3 Procedures

Participants  visited  the  Atatürk  University  Sports  Sciences 
Implementation and Research Centre on three separate occasions: a 
familiarization session and two experimental sessions (Figure 1). The 
familiarization session was scheduled before the onset of Ramadan, 
during  which  participants  were  not  fasting.  During  this  session, 
participants were acclimated to exercising with a respiratory gas mask 
and  a  sample  lactate  measurement  was  obtained.  Subsequently, 
maximal 20-meter sprint times were recorded twice (with a 3-min 
interval) and the best (shorter) time was used as the criterion score. 
Participants were required to achieve at least 95% of this criterion 
score during the initial sprints of both tests. Failure to do so resulted 
in test termination and a 5-min rest before reattempting.

The control session (non-fasting) was conducted within the last 3 
days before the start of Ramadan. The experimental session (fasting) 
took place during the first 3 days of Ramadan, ensuring that each 
participant had a 48–72-h gap between their control and experimental 
sessions.  All  tests  were  administered  between  16:00  and  18:00, 
corresponding to a fasting duration of 12–14 h for the experimental 
session. Participants executed a repeated sprint protocol consisting of 
ten  20-meter  sprints  with  15-s  passive  recovery  intervals.  Light-
sensitive photocell gates were employed, and athletes were instructed 
to initiate their sprints following a 3-s countdown indicated by the 
lighting  sequence.  Sprints  began  50 cm  behind  the  photocell  gate. 
Repeated-sprint  performance  metrics,  including  total  time  and 
percentage of speed decrement, were calculated based on formulas 
proposed by Glaister et al. (26).

A standardized warm-up protocol was performed before each 
testing session, consisting of 10 min of jogging and stretching and 
followed by three 5-meter acceleration drills. Efforts were made to 
minimize long-duration and high-intensity actions to prevent blood 
lactate accumulation and fatigue. Testing started 3 min post-warm-up. 
Anthropometric  assessments  were  conducted  using  standardized 
techniques  on  the  initial  test  day.  Height  was  measured  using  a 
portable  stadiometer  (Holtain  Ltd.,  Crosswell,  Crymych,  Dyfed, 
United Kingdom), whereas body mass and fat were evaluated via air 
displacement  plethysmography  (Bod  Pod,  Cosmed,  Chicago,  IL, 
United  States)  calibrated  as  per  manufacturer  guidelines.  Oxygen 
consumption (VO2) was measured using a portable metabolic gas 
analyzer (K5, Cosmed, Rome, Italy) during and 15 min post-exercise. 
Blood lactate concentrations were assessed pre-exercise and at the 1st, 
3rd, 5th, 7th and 10th minutes post-exercise, using capillary blood 
samples from the left-hand fingertip and analyzed with a portable 
hand  analyzer  (Lactate  Scout  +,  SensLab  GmbH,  Germany). 
Laboratory conditions were maintained at approximately 22°C and 
45% humidity throughout all testing sessions.

components  of  excess  post-exercise  oxygen  consumption  (EPOC) 
kinetics  utilizing  OriginPro  software  (version  2019b,  OriginLab, 
Northampton, MA, United States). The fast phase of EPOC (actual 
VO2 − slow phase VO2) was utilized as the representative of the alactic 
contribution  since  ATP-PCr  resynthesis  occurs  in  this  phase. 
Additionally, the energy contribution during the breaks was attributed 
to the alactic pathway considering that rest intervals are predominantly 
devoted  to  the  repayment  of  PCr  stores.  Nonetheless,  it  should 
be noted that our calculations operate under the assumption that the 
post-exercise replenishment of phosphocreatine (PCr) stores is solely 
mediated by the oxidative pathway. This model does not account for 
potential  minor  contributions  from  the  glycolytic  system  to  PCr 
resynthesis. Additionally, we assume that VO2 observed during the fast 
phase  of  EPOC  is  entirely  dedicated  to  the  replenishment  of  PCr 
stores,  thereby  neglecting  any  VO2  that  may  be  utilized  for  the 
re-binding of myoglobin (29).

2.4 Calculation of the energy pathway 
contributions

The  contributions  of  the  oxidative,  lactic  and  alactic  metabolic 
pathways  were  quantified  using  the  PCr-LA-O2  method  (27,  28). 
Oxygen uptake was assessed during exercise and a 15-min post-exercise 
period using a portable gas exchange system operating in breath-by-
breath mode. Prior to each test, the portable metabolic gas analyzer was 
calibrated  in  accordance  with  the  manufacturer’s  guidelines.  Blood 
lactate concentrations were ascertained from capillary blood samples 
obtained from the left-hand fingertip using a portable hand analyzer. 
Blood samples (20 μL) were collected at baseline and at subsequent 
intervals  during  the  recovery  phase  (1st,  3rd,  5th,  7th,  and  10th 
minutes) to determine peak lactate levels [BLapeak]. The delta lactate 
concentration [BLadelta] was calculated as the difference between BLapeak 
and baseline values. The oxidative pathway contribution was derived 
from VO2 levels exceeding the standing baseline (4.5 mL·kg−1·min−1) 
during the tests. The area under the curve of the actual VO2 minus the 
standing VO2 was used to quantify this contribution (29).

2.5 Statistical analysis

Data-processing procedures were conducted using SPSS 21.0 
(IBM  Corp,  Armonk,  NY,  United  States)  and  OriginPro  2019b 
software  (OriginLab  Corp.,  Northampton,  United  States).  The 
measures are reported as means and standard deviations. Normality 
of distribution was verified using the Shapiro–Wilk test. Differences 
between variables were calculated using the paired sample t-test. 
In addition, effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d (30) and 
were  classified  according  to  Hopkins  (31).  The  Hopkins’ 
classification for interpreting effect sizes is as follows: Effect sizes 
less than 0.2 are considered trivial, effect sizes between 0.2 and 0.6 
are  categorized  as  small,  effect  sizes  between  0.6  and  1.2  are 
considered moderate, effect sizes between 1.2 and 2.0 are classified 
as large, and effect sizes greater than 2.0 are considered very large. 
For  comparisons  of  sprint  times  within  a  protocol,  a  one-way 
analysis  of  variance  with  repeated  measurements  was  used.  A 
two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures 
was used to determine the effects of the state (control and fasting), 
sprints (1, 13, 22, 24, 27, 28, 32–35) and interaction (state×sprints),

followed by multiple comparisons. The assumptions of sphericity 
were  assessed  by  Mauchly’s  test.  Whenever  an  assumption  was 
violated, Greenhouse–Geisser correction if epsilon (ε) value was 
<0.75 and Huynh-Feldt correction if ε was >0.75 were applied to 
the degree of freedom. Statistical tests were deemed to be significant 
at p < 0.05.

3 Results

The worst sprint time during the fasting repeated sprints (RSfasting) 
was significantly higher than that during the non-fasting repeated 
sprints (RScontrol). However, no differences were recorded in the mean 
sprint time or the percentage of performance decrement (Table 1). 
Subsequent analysis two-way ANOVA revealed the main effects for 
both sprint sequence and nutritional states. Specifically, later sprints 
exhibited slower times compared to earlier ones and the fasting state 
was  associated  with  slower  times  relative  to  the  control  state. 
Importantly, no interaction effect was detected between the nutritional 
state and the sprint sequence in terms of absolute performance metrics 

(Figure 2). With respect to metabolic contributions, both in relative 
and absolute terms, no significant differences were identified in the 
contributions from the oxidative, lactic and alactic pathways (Table 1; 
Figures 3, 4).

4 Discussion

The  decline  in  physical  performance  during  Ramadan  has 
commonly  been  attributed  to  factors  such  as  caloric  restriction, 
alterations  in  macronutrient  composition  and  sleep  deprivation. 
However, the present investigation controlled for these variables and 
concentrated on shifts in energy metabolism. Our data revealed no 
statistically significant variations in the contributions of alactic, lactic 
and oxidative metabolic pathways during RSA in both fasting and 
non-fasting conditions contrary to our hypothesis. It should be noted, 
however, that whereas the volume of fluid intake remained constant 
over the two different conditions, the timing of fluid consumption was 
markedly  different  due  to  the  restrictions  imposed  by  the 
fasting period.

In this study involving athletes positioned in the middle of the 
training  and  performance  caliber  scale,  we  have  identified  that 
bioenergetic activities are similar in both fasting and non-fasting 
conditions.  However,  the  findings  indicate  that  there  may  be  a 
tendency  for  performance  outcomes  to  decline  during  more 
demanding exercise tasks while fasting. A recent systematic review 
by  Abaïdia  et  al.  (1)  highlighted  a  critical  methodological 
consideration in interpreting the outcomes of studies on this subject. 
The  review  concluded  that  elite  athletes  did  not  experience  a 
significant decline in performance, whereas sub-elite athletes with 
less  frequent  training  sessions  exhibited  a  more  pronounced 
performance decrement. Given that our study population consisted 
of  trained/developmental-level  football  players  (25),  our  findings 
align with this observation suggesting that fasting had a negligible 
impact  on  bioenergetic  contributions  and  performance  metrics. 
Nonetheless, the data imply that these effects could become more 
pronounced under more strenuous and extended exercise protocols. 
Therefore, it is imperative to consider multiple variables including the 
athletes’  training  level,  exercise  intensity  and  duration,  fatigue 
etiology and overall energy metabolism, when evaluating the effects 
of RIF on physical performance.

This study demonstrates that similar bioenergetic contributions 
can  be  achieved  during  repeated  sprints,  which  predominantly 
activate  the  lower  body  muscle  groups,  while  fasting.  It  has  been 
established  that  approximately  half  of  an  athlete’s  body  weight 
comprises  muscle  mass,  predominantly  localized  in  the  lower 
extremities (36, 37). This translates to an estimated 250–300 grams of 
glycogen storage in the muscles of athletes engaged in sprint activities. 
Given  that  this  storage  is  sufficient  to  meet  the  metabolic  energy 
demands  of  typical  sprinting  protocols,  performance  decrements 
during RIF are likely attributable to factors extrinsic to muscle cell 
activity, such as dehydration or hypoglycemia. In a standard feeding 
regimen, elevated blood glucose levels are expected within a few hours 
post-suhoor (i.e., the meal eaten before dawn during Ramadan). The 
rate of post-absorptive blood glucose utilization, primarily for hepatic 
glycogen  synthesis  and  glycolysis,  is  approximately  2 mg/kg/min, 
although glucose levels remain comparatively low until the iftar meal 
(i.e., the meal eaten at sundown during Ramadan; (22, 38)).

During  the  afternoon  phase  of  RIF,  skeletal  muscles  exhibit 
metabolic plasticity, transitioning from carbohydrates to lipids as the 
primary fuel source to conserve hepatic glycogen and maintain blood 
glucose levels (39, 40). However, high-intensity exercises like sprinting 
predominantly rely on muscle glycogen. Theoretically, the preservation 

of  muscle  glycogen  stores  until  training  implies  that  the  fuel 
requirements  during  sprints  remain  consistent  with  non-fasting 
conditions.  During  RSA  conducted  shortly  before  the  iftar  meal, 
working muscles require high-energy phosphates (ATP and CP) and 
glucose. Given that blood glucose equilibrium is primarily regulated

by  the  insulin/glucagon  balance,  hepatic  activation  and  ketone 
metabolism, it can be inferred that intramuscular glycogen stores are 
adequate for high-intensity muscle activation. Nonetheless, cognitive 
impairments associated with low blood glucose levels suggest that 
even when muscle cell metabolism is regular, disruptions may occur 
in the neural transmission pathways to the muscle cells.

Alterations  in  sleep  and  nutritional  patterns  during  Ramadan 
induce endocrinological changes (9, 34, 35). Monoamines, particularly 
serotonin,  modulate  both  sleep  and  metabolism  (35).  Prolonged 
carbohydrate  deprivation  may  prevent  tryptophan-dependent 
drowsiness, as dietary tryptophan is the biochemical precursor of 
serotonin  and  plasma  tryptophan 
following 
carbohydrate  ingestion  (35).  Additionally,  melatonin  induces 
drowsiness through its thermoregulatory effects and direct action on 
the central nervous system (33, 34). These endocrinological changes 
are closely related to the mechanisms for maintaining blood glucose 
and appear to support the use of muscle glycogen as an energy source 
during sprinting.

increase 

levels 

Cortisol  and  testosterone  levels  typically  peak  in  the  early 
morning (24, 33, 35), optimizing performance in activities requiring 
maximal effort or significant motor coordination. However, a shift in 
cortisol  secretion  patterns  during  Ramadan  has  been  observed, 
characterized by reduced morning and increased evening secretion 
(12, 41). Consistent with these findings, no substantial alterations in 
respiratory variables were observed during Ramadan (42). Although 
some studies reported a metabolic slowdown characterized by lower 
resting afternoon VO2 (1, 12, 32), our study suggests that metabolism 
can  adequately  respond  to  increased  energy  demands  during 
repeated sprints.

In this study, we employed a design that focused on bioenergetic 
activity during repeated sprints, where both anaerobic and aerobic 
metabolism  are  active,  while  controlling  for  other  variables.  Our 
findings challenge the common assumption that fasting negatively 
impacts energy metabolism pathways during high-intensity exercise. 
Notably, the results related to performance were close to the threshold 
of statistical significance, suggesting that outcomes could vary in more 
challenging exercise tasks. We implemented a protocol of ten 20-meter 
repeated sprints with 15-s passive recovery intervals. Such designs 
have dynamic variables, including increasing the number of sprints, 
extending sprint distance, or reducing rest time, indicating that results 
could  differ  in  more  demanding  exercise  tasks.  Furthermore,  the 
athlete group in our study, when assessed in terms of training and 
performance caliber, is situated at the third level of a six-tier scale (2, 
12, 24). It’s conceivable that athletes at higher levels could withstand 
more strenuous exercise tasks even while fasting. Thus, it’s important 
to remember that many factors need to be considered in such studies. 
In conclusion, our study highlights the complex nature of bioenergetic 
performance in athletes during Ramadan fasting and the potential 
impacts of various factors on this performance. It is clear that more 
research  is  needed  to  fully  understand  these  effects  and  their 
implications for athletes’ performance.

5 Conclusion

To the best of our knowledge, the present study represents the 
inaugural  investigation  of  the  effects  of  RIF  on  repeated  sprint 
performance,  with  a  specific  focus  on  associated  bioenergetic 

pathways. The worst sprint time during the fasting repeated sprints 
was significantly higher than that during the non-fasting repeated 
sprints. However, no differences were recorded in the mean sprint 
time or the percentage of performance decrement. In the context of 
bioenergetic contributions and total energy expenditure, values were 
not different between the two conditions. Consequently, while our 
experimental protocol did not yield unequivocal disparities between 
the fasting and non-fasting states in terms of performance metrics and 
metabolic parameters, it intimates that such differences could become 
more salient in protocols of extended duration and elevated intensity, 
favoring the non-fasting state.

6 Future studies

The  study  controls  for  key  variables  like  calorie  intake, 
macronutrient proportions and sleep duration, thereby isolating the 
effects of fasting on energy metabolism. However, the timing of fluid 
intake,  which  is  significantly  altered  during  Ramadan,  could  be  a 
variable  worth  exploring  in  future  research.  Our  findings  lay  the 
groundwork  for  future  studies  to  delve  deeper  into  the  metabolic 
markers and energy production mechanisms associated with varying 
exercise intensities and durations during Ramadan. Understanding 
these nuances is crucial for athletes and coaches aiming to optimize 
training and performance during this period. Moreover, the study 
opens avenues for investigating how religious and cultural practices 
intersect with sports science, offering a multidisciplinary lens that 
could  enrich  both  fields.  In  summary,  while  our  study  does  not 
provide definitive answers, it raises pertinent questions and provides 
a  robust  framework  for  future  research  in  exercise  physiology, 
particularly in the context of religious fasting.

7 Strengths and limitations

The present study uniquely investigates the effects of fasting on 
athletic  performance  from  the  perspective  of  bioenergetic 
contributions.  We  utilized  a  comprehensive  methodology  that 
allowed  us  to  discern  the  contributions  from  all  three  energy 
systems—anaerobic alactic, anaerobic lactic, and aerobic—providing 
a holistic understanding of how fasting impacts different aspects of 
energy utilization during repeated sprint activities. Furthermore, the 
use of repeated sprints as the performance metric aligns with the 
demands of many team sports, enhancing the ecological validity of 
our findings. Additionally, this study design carefully controlled the 
timing of data collection to ensure that both fasting and non-fasting 
sessions  occurred  within  the  same  week,  minimizing  potential 
confounding factors due to time variations. However, it’s important 
to  note  some  limitations.  First,  our  study  had  a  relatively  small 
sample size of intermediate-level football players, which may limit 
the  generalizability  of  our  findings  to  elite  or  sub-elite  athletes. 
Second, the study design focused on the initial days of Ramadan, 
and different results might be observed in the later stages of fasting. 
Finally,  while  we  controlled  for  several  variables,  there  may  still 
be unaccounted factors that could influence the outcomes. Future 
research with larger and more diverse populations and extended 
observation periods could provide further insights into the effects 
of fasting on athletic performance.

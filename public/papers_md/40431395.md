Abstract: Vitamin D and magnesium are essential nutrients that play key roles in an
athlete’s performance, recovery, and overall health. Vitamin D is crucial for bone health
(aiding calcium absorption and preventing stress fractures), muscle function (preventing
weakness and injury), and reducing respiratory infections. Magnesium is fundamental in
muscle function, adenosine triphosphate production for muscle contraction, electrolyte
balance, bone strength, and cardiovascular health. The magnesium requirement of healthy
adults is estimated at 300–400 mg/day, but there is evidence that athletes may have higher
magnesium needs compared to sedentary persons. Magnesium and vitamin D are closely
linked—vitamin D aids magnesium absorption, while magnesium is vital for vitamin
D synthesis, transport, and activation. Given their importance in athletes, this article
explores their functions, interactions, and the effects of deficiencies and supplementation in
athletic populations.

Keywords: vitamin D; magnesium; athlete; muscle; bone; ATP; cardiovascular; respiratory

1. Introduction

Proper nutrition is crucial for athletes to enhance their performance during training
and competitions and maintain internal balance. A variety of foods and supplements is
needed to meet nutritional needs [1,2]. Adequate nutrition provides energy, supports body
structure, and supplies essential vitamins and minerals that regulate metabolic processes.
However, despite sufficient intake, athletes may still face nutrient deficiencies, which can
hinder performance and increase injury risk [2,3]. Magnesium and vitamin D are key
nutrients that are essential for athletic performance, recovery, and overall health.

Once known mainly for its role in calcium balance, vitamin D is now recognized as
a hormone with wide-ranging effects on immunity, protein and hormone synthesis, gene
signaling, and cell regeneration [4,5]. Primarily synthesized through sun exposure, smaller
amounts come from foods like oily fish, egg yolks, and dairy [6]. Its importance in sports
nutrition is increasingly acknowledged, mainly due to the high prevalence of vitamin D

deficiency across many sports, which has been linked to reduced strength, endurance,
and greater injury risk [7–9]. Studies show that 32% of professional basketball players are
deficient and 47% have insufficient 25(OH)D levels. In the National Football League (NFL),
26% are deficient and 42–80% have insufficient levels. Similar trends are seen in swimmers,
dancers, taekwondo fighters, volleyball players, weightlifters, runners, and others [10].

Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in over 600 enzymatic reactions [11], in-
cluding energy metabolism [11–13], cell growth [14,15], glycolysis [16,17], and protein syn-
thesis [18,19]. As Mg2+, it forms the Mg-ATP complex [11,12,18,20]—vital for energy pro-
duction and key physiological functions like muscle contraction [21–23], blood pressure
regulation [24,25], and nerve conduction [26]. Magnesium is crucial for muscle function,
supporting energy metabolism and proper contraction/relaxation [27–30]. Higher serum
magnesium levels are linked to better muscle performance in both older adults [22,31] and ath-
letes [32,33]. Deficiency may impair neuromuscular function and contribute to cramps, [34,35]
although evidence on its role in exercise-induced cramps remains limited [36].

Magnesium and vitamin D are closely interconnected—vitamin D supports the ab-
sorption of magnesium, while magnesium plays a critical role in the synthesis, transport,
and activation of vitamin D [37,38]. Because magnesium and vitamin D are essential in
athletes, this article will discuss their overall functions, their interaction, and the implica-
tions of their deficiencies and supplementation in athletes. Although there are reviews and
meta-analyses on vitamin D and magnesium in athletes, the available studies are small
and inconclusive. Therefore, we aim to raise interest in developing future more powerful
studies about these essential nutrients in the athletes.

For the present article, we performed a search of the literature published in PubMed,
from database inception to 1 March 2025, utilizing terms such as “vitamin D” or “magne-
sium” and “athlete” or “systematic review” or “meta-analysis” or “umbrella” or “random-
ized controlled trial” or “RCT” or “trial”. We enhanced the search by incorporating studies
known to the authors and conducting additional forward citation searches. We excluded
other types of articles, such as editorials, comments, letters to the editor, case reports, case
series, short communications, short reports, and perspectives.

2. Vitamin D in Athletes

Despite assumptions that outdoor athletes have adequate vitamin D, recent studies
show their levels are similar to the general population. Factors like geography and sport
type affect vitamin D status. Deficiency can lead to higher morbidity and conditions like
osteomalacia, osteoporosis, and other extraskeletal diseases.

2.1. Synthesis, Sources, Metabolism, and Assessment

Since Nobel laureate Windaus identified vitamin D’s structure in 1930 [39], research
has evolved from focusing on bone metabolism to broader health areas. The discovery of
25(OH)D in 1968 [40,41] and 1,25(OH)2D [42,43] expanded its study to immune diseases,
infections, cardiovascular issues, and cancer [44,45]. Vitamin D regulates the immune
system, influences T lymphocytes, cytokines, and apoptosis [4,46], and promotes phosphate
and magnesium absorption while preventing renal excretion. Its functions extend far
beyond bone health.

Vitamin D is primarily synthesized in the skin, with dietary intake playing a smaller
role due to limited daily consumption of vitamin D-rich foods, even among athletes. Table 1
lists dietary sources of vitamin D. Supplements may be needed for those at risk of deficiency,
including athletes.

Cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D3 occurs from 7-dehydrocholesterol upon UV expo-
sure (290–320 nm) [44]; UV exposure equivalent to 25% of the minimum erythematic dose
(MED) generates 25 µg (1000 IU) [47], while 15 min of midday sun (∼1 MED) produces
250 µg (10,000 IU) [48]. Face, hand, and arm exposure to one-third to one-sixth of MED
yields 200–600 IU of vitamin D [49]. Factors like age, season, skin color, latitude, and
sunscreen use affect synthesis efficiency [50–52].

After entering circulation, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and D3 (cholecalciferol) bind
weakly to their binding protein (DBP) for transport and are stored in fat. In the liver, they
are converted to 25(OH)D—the main circulating form—by CYP2R1 and CYP27A1, with
additional conversion possible in other tissues [53]. High doses may slow this process [54].
In the kidneys, CYP27B1 forms active 1,25(OH)2D, while CYP24A1 produces inactive
24,25(OH)2D [55] (see Table 2 for details). The active form regulates functions via vitamin
D receptor (VDR) [53], discovered in 1969 [56], and cloned in 1987 [57,58]. VDR is essential
for vitamin D function, as shown in knockout models [59], and is widely present in
human tissues [60,61].

Serum 25(OH)D is the best accepted marker of vitamin D status and is used to assess deﬁciency and guide intake recommendations [63]. By contrast, 1,25(OH)2D is tightly regulated and levels may remain normal in deﬁciency due to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, which stimulates its production. Optimal vitamin D keeps PTH within normal limits [6]. An international consensus deﬁned vitamin D status as suﬃcient >20 ng/mL, insuﬃcient 12–20 ng/mL, deﬁcient <12 ng/mL, and potential toxicity >100 ng/mL with high calcium intake [64]. 2.2. Vitamin D Deﬁciency in Athletes Vitamin D deﬁciency is common across sports, with 32% of professional basketball players and 26% of NFL players being deﬁcient; 42–80% showed insuﬃciency. Similar trends appear in swimmers, dancers, weightlifters, and others [10]. Dark-skinned athletes need up to 10 times more UVB to produce adequate vitamin D. By contrast, a study of mostly Caucasian hockey players showed no deﬁciency and only 13% showed insuﬃciency [65]. Athletes living north of 35° N (e.g., Finland, Russia) face reduced UV exposure, especially in winter, limiting vitamin D synthesis [66]. In Finland (60° N), over 80% of athletes had low 25(OH)D levels [67]. Among Russian youth soccer players, 42.8% had below 30 ng/mL, but 5000 IU/day of cholecalciferol for two months raised levels to 30–60 ng/mL in 74% [68]. A recent meta-analysis found outdoor athletes had slightly higher vitamin D levels than indoor athletes, with a crude diﬀerence of 3.73 ng/mL—signiﬁcant only in Asian groups. After adjusting for season, latitude, and race, indoor athletes had 4.45 ng/mL lower levels. However, training type alone had minimal impact, suggesting it should not solely guide supplementation decisions [69]. Another meta-analysis of 23 studies (2313 athletes, mean age 22.5) found that 56% had low 25(OH)D (<32 ng/mL) levels, especially in winter/spring, indoor/mixed sports, and at latitudes >40° N [70]. Supplementation improves vitamin D levels but the eﬀects on muscle performance are mixed [71].

A recent study using a food frequency and lifestyle questionnaire (FFLQ) in athletes
found no link between vitamin D intake and serum 25(OH)D levels. However, strong
correlations were observed with tanning bed use (spring), supplement intake (fall), and BMI
year-round, suggesting non-dietary factors significantly influence vitamin D status [62].

Serum 25(OH)D is the best accepted marker of vitamin D status and is used to assess
deficiency and guide intake recommendations [63]. By contrast, 1,25(OH)2D is tightly
regulated and levels may remain normal in deficiency due to elevated parathyroid hormone
(PTH) levels, which stimulates its production. Optimal vitamin D keeps PTH within normal
limits [6]. An international consensus defined vitamin D status as sufficient >20 ng/mL,
insufficient 12–20 ng/mL, deficient <12 ng/mL, and potential toxicity >100 ng/mL with
high calcium intake [64].

2.2. Vitamin D Deficiency in Athletes

Vitamin D deficiency is common across sports, with 32% of professional basketball
players and 26% of NFL players being deficient; 42–80% showed insufficiency. Similar
trends appear in swimmers, dancers, weightlifters, and others [10]. Dark-skinned athletes
need up to 10 times more UVB to produce adequate vitamin D. By contrast, a study of mostly
Caucasian hockey players showed no deficiency and only 13% showed insufficiency [65].
Athletes living north of 35◦ N (e.g., Finland, Russia) face reduced UV exposure, especially
in winter, limiting vitamin D synthesis [66]. In Finland (60◦ N), over 80% of athletes had
low 25(OH)D levels [67]. Among Russian youth soccer players, 42.8% had below 30 ng/mL,
but 5000 IU/day of cholecalciferol for two months raised levels to 30–60 ng/mL in 74% [68].
A recent meta-analysis found outdoor athletes had slightly higher vitamin D levels
than indoor athletes, with a crude difference of 3.73 ng/mL—significant only in Asian
groups. After adjusting for season, latitude, and race, indoor athletes had 4.45 ng/mL
lower levels. However, training type alone had minimal impact, suggesting it should
not solely guide supplementation decisions [69]. Another meta-analysis of 23 studies
(2313 athletes, mean age 22.5) found that 56% had low 25(OH)D (<32 ng/mL) levels,
especially in winter/spring, indoor/mixed sports, and at latitudes >40◦ N [70]. Supple-
mentation improves vitamin D levels but the effects on muscle performance are mixed [71].
As such, a meta-analysis of 13 RCTs (433 athletes) showed 3000–5000 IU/day raised serum
levels, especially in winter and >45◦ N, but had no clear effect on performance after
12 weeks—likely due to trial heterogeneity [72]. More targeted RCTs are needed. However,
it is important to clarify that vitamin D is necessary to maintain muscle mass and function
but does not have anabolic effects.

In elite Para-athletes, a systematic review of 10 studies (n = 355; 69.6% male) found
that 43.2% showed insufficiency and 28.1% had deficient vitamin D levels, with higher
insufficiency in winter (74.1%) compared to summer (57.1%), which is still remarkably high.

However, training type alone had minimal impact, suggesting it should not solely guide supplementation decisions [69]. Another meta-analysis of 23 studies (2313 athletes, mean age 22.5) found that 56% had low 25(OH)D (<32 ng/mL) levels, especially in winter/spring, indoor/mixed sports, and at latitudes >40° N [70]. Supplementation improves vitamin D levels but the eﬀects on muscle performance are mixed [71].

Serum 25(OH)D is the best accepted marker of vitamin D status and is used to assess deﬁciency and guide intake recommendations [63]. By contrast, 1,25(OH)2D is tightly regulated and levels may remain normal in deﬁciency due to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, which stimulates its production. Optimal vitamin D keeps PTH within normal limits [6]. An international consensus deﬁned vitamin D status as suﬃcient >20 ng/mL, insuﬃcient 12–20 ng/mL, deﬁcient <12 ng/mL, and potential toxicity >100 ng/mL with high calcium intake [64]. 2.2. Vitamin D Deﬁciency in Athletes Vitamin D deﬁciency is common across sports, with 32% of professional basketball players and 26% of NFL players being deﬁcient; 42–80% showed insuﬃciency. Similar trends appear in swimmers, dancers, weightlifters, and others [10]. Dark-skinned athletes need up to 10 times more UVB to produce adequate vitamin D. By contrast, a study of mostly Caucasian hockey players showed no deﬁciency and only 13% showed insuﬃciency [65]. Athletes living north of 35° N (e.g., Finland, Russia) face reduced UV exposure, especially in winter, limiting vitamin D synthesis [66]. In Finland (60° N), over 80% of athletes had low 25(OH)D levels [67]. Among Russian youth soccer players, 42.8% had below 30 ng/mL, but 5000 IU/day of cholecalciferol for two months raised levels to 30–60 ng/mL in 74% [68]. A recent meta-analysis found outdoor athletes had slightly higher vitamin D levels than indoor athletes, with a crude diﬀerence of 3.73 ng/mL—signiﬁcant only in Asian groups.

As such, a meta-analysis of 13 RCTs (433 athletes) showed 3000–5000 IU/day raised serum levels, Nutrients 2025, 17, 1655

Wheelchair athletes in indoor sports were especially at risk [73]. Ongoing education and
preventive strategies are necessary for these athletes.

Physical exercise can boost vitamin D levels. Studies show that regular exercise or high
activity is linked to higher serum 25(OH)D levels, even with limited sun exposure [74–76].
One study found this effect in both summer and winter [77]. Sun et al. showed that
30 min of cycling at 70% VO2max significantly raised 25(OH)D levels, especially in men [78].
Similar increases were seen after stretch-shortening cycle exercises [79]. However, some
studies found no acute changes, possibly due to timing issues [80,81].

Thus, routine vitamin D testing and targeted supplementation—especially in winter,
low-UVB regions, and/or indoor athletes—are key to supporting performance, maintaining
athlete health, and preventing issues like stress fractures. Adequate levels may offer broader
health benefits, but supplementation should be individualized to avoid excessive dosing
and potential risks.

2.3. Effects of Vitamin D of Particular Interest for Athletes

Vitamin D affects more than bone health due to VDRs in many tissues—skin, muscle,
immune cells, brain, and fat, among others [4,5,60,61,82]. VDR activation by 1,25(OH)2D
triggers genomic and non-genomic effects, including immune modulation, muscle reg-
ulation, anti-cancer activity, and potential benefits for cardiovascular and metabolic
health—many of which are especially relevant to athletes [82].

2.3.1. Muscle

Muscle weakness is a common, though non-specific, symptom of vitamin D defi-
ciency [6], highlighting its importance in athletic performance [83]. Calcitriol through
the VDR in muscle tissue promotes cell growth and type II fiber development, enhanc-
ing strength and speed [83–89]. Though early debate questioned VDR presence in mus-
cle [85,86], later studies confirmed it [87]. While some research links vitamin D to better
muscle performance, the results are mixed, possibly due to varying deficiency levels and
response to supplementation [71]. Still, studies showed improved type II fiber size af-
ter treatment [90], and that higher pre-exercise 25(OH)D levels may reduce post-exercise
muscle weakness and aid recovery [79].

Vitamin D’s direct effects on muscle have been mainly studied in preclinical mod-
els. In skeletal muscle, 1,25(OH)2D binds to VDR, initiating genomic and nongenomic
responses (Figure 1). Genomically, it forms a VDR-RXR complex that regulates gene expres-
sion via VDRE. Nongenomically, VDR localized to the membrane triggers rapid signaling
(e.g., c-Src, MAPK) and enhances myosin–actin interaction, enhancing muscle contraction,
proteostasis, and calcium homeostasis [5,53]. High doses of 1,25(OH)2D can inhibit my-
oblast proliferation but promote hypertrophy in mature myotubes. In C2C12 muscle cells,
1,25(OH)2D3 increases myogenin expression through a VDRE on its promoter, resulting
in larger myotubes and elevated myosin heavy chain expression, underscoring its role in
muscle development [91].

Whole-body and tissue-specific VDR knockout models show decreased grip strength
and muscle fiber size, alongside increased atrophy-related gene expression, underscoring
VDR’s role in muscle integrity. Post-injury vitamin D enhances regeneration by promoting
cell proliferation, reducing apoptosis, and aiding repair [92]. Vitamin D also modulates
calcium transport via nongenomic actions, facilitating contraction, while VDR activation
regulates calcium flow, further supporting muscle function [93].

Therefore, an optimal level of vitamin D appears essential for athletes to maintain
muscle health and aid in injury repair, but there are few studies specifically focused on
these actions. There is considerable room for further study.

D receptor).

2.3.2. Bone

Through VDR activation by 1,25(OH)2D, vitamin D enhances calcium, phosphate, and
magnesium absorption, supports bone mineralization, and stimulates osteocalcin [5,44].
Alongside parathyroid hormone (PTH), it promotes bone resorption via receptor activator
of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) signaling. Vitamin D also inhibits PTH and
induces FGF23, forming a feedback loop that maintains calcium–phosphate balance and
supports bone growth [6,94].

An observational study of NFL players found lower vitamin D levels in those with
fractures, independent of career length [95]. A 2015 RCT in young male jockeys showed that
vitamin D supplementation improved bone properties—such as cortical content, density,
and bone area—within six months [96].

Bone stress injuries make up ~20% of sports medicine cases [97] and are common
among athletes and military recruits, often linked to pain, performance loss, and training
time missed [98]. Nearly one-third of runners [99] and 21.1% of track athletes report stress
fractures [100]. There is evidence suggesting that vitamin D could play a role in preventing
stress fractures in athletes [83]. Risk factors include sudden training increases, low bone
mineral density (BMD), menstrual irregularities, and low vitamin D levels. Serum 25(OH)D
levels below 20 ng/mL are associated with higher stress fracture risk [101], while higher
levels support faster recovery [102].

A large RCT in U.S. Navy women (n = 3700) showed that daily vitamin D and calcium
supplementation reduced stress fractures by 20% [103]. However, data on elite athletes
remain limited due to complex influencing factors (i.e., age, overtraining, poor diet, smok-
ing, and potential menstrual disorders). A meta-analysis by Dao et al. including 8 studies
found significantly lower 25(OH)D levels in military personnel with stress fractures [104].
Shimasaki et al. reported that Japanese male soccer players with 25(OH)D levels below
30 ng/mL had a higher risk of fifth metatarsal stress fractures [105]. In a two-year study,
Nieves et al. found that vitamin D intake in young female runners was associated with
higher hip BMD and fewer stress fractures [106].

Thus, the usual bone mineralization actions of vitamin D are necessary in athletes,
and its deficiency, frequent in this population, may be related to the increased risk of stress
fractures, even in this young population.

2.3.3. Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems

Intense training, especially in running sports, induces cardiovascular adaptations
that may mimic pathology but reflect well-adapted organs [107]. While vitamin D’s role
in cardiovascular disease is debated despite extensive research [108,109], evidence from
animal and human studies shows that deficiency negatively affects heart structure and
function. In athletes, low vitamin D levels are linked to reduced cardiac hypertrophy
following training [110,111].

Vitamin D and its binding protein are vital for lung function. Deficiency is linked
to respiratory conditions like asthma, infections, and chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease [6]. College athletes with low vitamin D levels face increased risk of acute upper
respiratory infections (URTIs) [112].

Maintaining vitamin D levels above 38 ng/mL helps to protect against viral infections;
levels below this double the risk of URTIs [113]. In athletes, levels above 30 ng/mL support
immunity and reduce URTI risk [114]. Supplementing with 4000 IU/day is effective in
high-risk groups [115], and adequate levels are linked to lower influenza A rates [116] and
were shown to potentially reduce COVID-19 mortality [4,117]. A meta-analysis of 25 RCTs
found that vitamin D lowers respiratory infection risk, especially with daily/weekly dosing
and in individuals with very low (<10 ng/mL) baseline levels (−70% risk) [118]. This is
particularly relevant in athletes who frequently have vitamin D deficiency [10,65–68] and
increased risk of infections.

Athletes have higher rates of asthma and allergic rhinitis than the general population.
Low vitamin D levels are associated with elevated eosinophils, IgE, severe asthma, and
increased hospitalizations [114]. Screening athletes and providing vitamin D supplementa-
tion may help to reduce asthma flare-ups and URTIs.

Thus, the role of vitamin D in cardiac function in athletes is not well defined. From a
respiratory perspective, it is essential to prevent and treat vitamin D deficiency due to the
increased risk of asthma and respiratory infections in this population.

3. Magnesium in Athletes

Magnesium, essential in all living cells, acts as a key cofactor for ATP—the main source
of cellular energy—to which it is closely associated [11,16,25,119,120]. Its roles in energy
production, muscle function, and glucose regulation make it a potential performance
mediator and enhancer for athletes.

3.1. The Importance of Magnesium in Cellular Function

Magnesium is vital for numerous cellular functions, binding to nucleotides and reg-
ulating over 600 enzymatic reactions, including those for DNA/RNA processes and
all ATPase reactions [11,16,25,121] (Table 3).
It supports glucose, lipid, and protein
metabolism [122–124], neuromuscular and cardiac function, hormone release, and CNS sig-
naling [24,125–127]. Furthermore, it functions as a secondary messenger in intracellular sig-
naling pathways [125,128–130], regulating circadian rhythm [131] and ion transport [132].
Magnesium is 98% intracellular, with only 2% in serum, which is tightly regu-
lated by intake, absorption, renal excretion, bone storage, and tissue demand [16,25,133].
Magnesium-rich foods are primarily plant based (Table 4).

Many in Europe and the U.S. have low magnesium intake due to processed
diets [134–138]. Deficiency, even mild, is linked to obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and other
chronic diseases via inflammation and oxidative stress [11,16,17,24,119,122]. Severe defi-
ciency (hypomagnesemia) (serum levels <0.75 mmol/L, <1.7 mg/dL) causes nonspecific
symptoms like fatigue and cramps [11] and is more common in people with type 2 diabetes
and hospitalized patients [139]. It is associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular

mortality [139,140]. Other people for which magnesium deficiency is particularly common
are athletes, as will be discussed below.

3.2. Magnesium Deficiency in Athletes

Exercise influences magnesium use and distribution, while magnesium supports
strength and cardiorespiratory function [11,24,141]. In response to exercise, magnesium
is transported to areas where energy production occurs [142]. During prolonged activity,
magnesium shifts to muscles to aid energy production; short-term exercise may raise serum
levels due to reduced plasma volume [141]. Endurance exercise can cause magnesium loss
through sweat, increasing deficiency risk and arrhythmia [143] while increasing magne-
sium requirements [29]. A study in well-hydrated endurance athletes found no plasma
magnesium changes during incremental cycling, emphasizing plasma volume and hydra-
tion as key factors in magnesium balance during exercise [144]. Conversely, a study by
Siquier-Coll et al. assessed magnesium and phosphorus level changes post-exercise in
normothermic (22 ◦C) and hyperthermic (42 ◦C) conditions, reporting that hyperthermic
exercise lowered magnesium levels but not phosphorus levels. Heat acclimation reduced
magnesium loss in sweat but increased urinary excretion, with the authors concluding that
magnesium supplementation is advisable for athletes in hot conditions [145].

Regular exercise benefits physical fitness [146], mental health [147,148], and chronic
disease prevention [149,150]. Nutrient availability, including magnesium, is key for muscle
adaptations to endurance and resistance training [151–155]. Magnesium supports nerve
function, muscle contraction [125,156,157], energy metabolism, the immune response, and
reduces oxidative stress [11,37,142,158]. Intense exercise increases magnesium needs due
to inflammation and muscle damage [159]. Athletes may have higher magnesium require-
ments compared to sedentary individuals [29,160]. Deficiency can impair performance [161]

Nutrients 2025, 17, 1655

9 of 25

and cause issues like oxidative damage [162], arrhythmias [163], muscle weakness [29],
and hypomagnesemia [164]. Athletes may require supplementation when dietary intake
is insufficient.

Blood magnesium levels vary with exercise intensity and duration—rising briefly after
short, intense activity and dropping after prolonged endurance exercise, often due to sweat
loss [29,165]. Studies show that many athletes, including ultra-endurance racers, rugby
players, and elite female gymnasts, fail to meet recommended magnesium intake levels,
highlighting a widespread risk of deficiency among active individuals [166–170]. Czaja et al.
found that elite Polish runners consumed 256 ± 111 mg (females) and 284 ± 58 mg (males)
of magnesium daily. However, diet analysis software overestimated intake by 159–181%,
indicating that food records may not reliably reflect actual magnesium intake [168].

Thus, physically active persons are at greater risk of magnesium deficiency due
to increased demands; hence,
they may require more magnesium than inactive
people [29,30,171,172]. A systematic review of 14 studies found that athletes had lower
serum magnesium levels despite higher intake and urinary excretion, suggesting higher
needs [173]. In addition, a meta-analysis of 31 studies showed that most athletes consumed
less than the RDA [174]. Pollock et al. found that 22% of elite British Olympic and Para-
lympic athletes had intracellular magnesium deficiency, especially among women, those of
Black/Mixed ethnicity, and those with Achilles/patella tendon pain [175].

Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that magnesium levels are sufficient in the
diet of athletes and supplementation may be necessary, especially in high-performance
athletes, due to the greater consumption and therefore greater requirements for this
fundamental nutrient.

3.3. Effects of Magnesium of Particular Interest for Athletes

Exercise and magnesium have a reciprocal relationship—exercise regulates magnesium
distribution for energy needs, while magnesium supports muscle strength, cardiovascular
health, bone integrity, and immunity.

3.3.1. Muscle

Magnesium is essential for skeletal muscle function, supporting energy production,
protein synthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis [11,119] (Table 5). It influences
neuromuscular function, cell signaling, bone development, cell proliferation, and genomic
stability [11,176]. Magnesium supports ion transport, muscle contraction, neuron excitabil-
ity, and cellular ion balance [119,177]. Its high solubility, small ionic radius, and strong
hydratability make it highly stable and larger than other cations (i.e., calcium, potassium,
and sodium). This limits its ability to pass through narrow channels, requiring energy-
consuming dehydration—explaining its role as a natural calcium channel blocker [178,179].

About one-third of muscle magnesium is in mitochondria, which are essential for
energy metabolism [180]. Magnesium supports mitochondrial function, with deficiency
leading to reduced efficiency, increased oxidative stress, and reduced aerobic capacity in
muscle [180,181]. Thus, it is essential for energy metabolism and mitochondrial health.
Magnesium deficiency impairs mitochondrial efficiency, increases reactive oxygen species
production, and contributes to muscle decline [11,22].
It activates key glycolytic en-
zymes [17,182] and forms Mg-ATP, the biologically active ATP form that is vital for muscle
contraction and enzyme function [180]. In fact, most ATP exists as Mg-ATP, the active form
needed for enzymatic activity and energy production [11,176]. A summary of the role of
magnesium in mitochondria is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2. Magnesium is crucial for energy production, as ATP cannot be activated until it binds with
magnesium. The ability of muscle to maintain its available energy during alterations in workload is
critical for normal function. Magnesium plays a role in sarcolemma transport, energy metabolism,
and the processes of muscle contraction and relaxation. Additionally, magnesium helps to reduce
oxidative stress (reactive oxygen species). ADP: adenosine diphosphate; ATP: adenosine triphosphate.

Magnesium supplementation has shown mixed results in improving athletic per-
formance. Positive outcomes were noted in recreational athletes [183] and elite soccer
players [184], but most RCTs found no improvements in muscle strength or performance
in volleyball players [185], triathletes [186], cyclists [187], physically active men [188] and
women [189], recreational runners [190], or marathon runners [191]. However, these studies
often did not assess magnesium status or relied on plasma/serum measurements, which
are less sensitive to change.

Variability in supplementation outcomes may stem from differences in magnesium
status at baseline, dosing, duration (10 days to 32 weeks), and salt form used (e.g., citrate,
oxide, lactate, sulfate, bisglycinate chelate, and magnesium creatine chelate). Most studies
focused on young adults, understandably because most athletes or physically active persons
are young. However, an example of magnesium’s benefit for muscle function is its role in
counteracting age-related decline. In the InCHIANTI study, higher magnesium levels were
linked to better muscle performance [22]. In addition, Veronese et al. found that 12 weeks
of supplementation (300 mg/day) improved physical function in older women, especially
those with dietary intakes below the RDA [31].

Thus, there is little doubt that magnesium is essential for muscle function and that its

deficiency, likely in athletes with higher requirements, should be avoided and corrected.

3.3.2. Bone

Fragility fractures pose a major public health issue, impacting health, quality of
life, and increasing societal costs [192,193]. While calcium and vitamin D are well stud-
ied, other dietary components can contribute [194]. As such, magnesium plays a role as
well, and its deficiency is linked to increased osteoclast activity and reduced osteoblast
function [195–198], which may be improved with supplementation [196,197,199–201].

Several studies link higher dietary magnesium intake to improved BMD [202–205]
and possibly reduced fracture risk [204,206], although fracture data are less conclusive
due to limited study quality. A recent meta-analysis by our group including four high-
quality studies (119,755 participants) found that low serum magnesium levels are strongly
associated with increased fracture risk [207], underscoring magnesium’s importance in
bone health and its potential as a modifiable risk factor, especially in at-risk groups
like athletes.

Magnesium deficiency has been associated with lower BMD. In a study of elite swim-
mers, Matias et al. found that magnesium intake was below recommended levels and
strongly predicted BMD, even after adjusting for relevant confounders (i.e., energy, calcium,
vitamin D, and phosphorus intake) [208], highlighting its importance for bone health in
young athletes in low-impact sports.

Although there is evidence from preclinical studies of the importance of magnesium in
bone health, there is no definitive evidence of its role in fracture prevention, and very few
studies have been conducted in athletes. Hence, there is ample room for future research.

3.3.3. Cardiovascular System

Magnesium imbalance is linked to cardiovascular issues [24,119,140]. Low magnesium
levels increase arrhythmia risk (i.e., atrial fibrillation, torsades de pointes, and long QT
syndrome) [11,119,209] and contribute to vascular problems like endothelial dysfunction
and hypertension [24]. In pregnancy-related hypertension (preeclampsia/eclampsia), intra-
venous magnesium helps to reduce complications via calcium channel blockade, vasodi-
lation, and other mechanisms such as lowering oxidative stress and regulating Transient
Receptor Potential Cation Channel Subfamily M Member (TRPM) 6 and TRPM7 [24,210,211]
(Table 6).

promoting atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular calcification [11,119,212,214]. It also

stabilizes membranes by blocking calcium channels [215] and regulating potassium, which
contributes to antiarrhythmic effects. Strong evidence links even mild deficiency to car-
diovascular disease [216], making inadequate magnesium intake a frequent public health
concern (Table 4).

While physical activity offers many benefits, athletes can still develop heart disease.
Celeski et al. found that high exercise levels may be associated with higher coronary artery
calcium scores and atherosclerotic plaque burden, especially calcified types, challenging
the assumption they are harmless [217]. More large-scale studies are needed to understand
the risks in athletes.

Elite athletes may be more prone to hypomagnesemia, which has been linked to
a higher risk of sudden death from arrhythmias [218]—more common in athletes than
in the general population [219]. Stendig and Lindberg linked sudden death in athletes
during exertion to chronic magnesium deficiency [220], a connection first reported by
Chadda et al. [221]. Magnesium loss through sweat in endurance running can lead to
severe deficiency and increase the risk of serious arrhythmias [143,163].

Correcting magnesium levels helps to control ventricular response in atrial fibrillation,
reduce ventricular extrasystoles, and prevent torsades de pointes. It may also benefit
polymorphic and supraventricular tachycardia [163]. Magnesium deficiency increases
arrhythmia risk through calcium overload, electrolyte imbalance, impaired Na+/K+-ATPase
activity, and inflammation-related cardiac effects [163,218]. A study of 88,375 women from
the Nurses’ Health Study found that higher dietary and plasma magnesium levels were
linked to significantly lower sudden cardiac death (SCD) risk. Over 26 years, 505 SCD cases
occurred, with a 37% lower risk in participants with high dietary magnesium levels and
77% lower risk with high plasma levels. Each 0.25 mg/dL increase in plasma magnesium
level reduced the SCD risk by 41% [222].

In the Rotterdam Study, among 9820 adults (mean age 65.1), each 0.1 mmol/L increase
in serum magnesium level was linked to an 18% lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD)
death. Those in the lowest serum magnesium quartile had a 36% higher CHD mortality
risk and 54% higher SCD risk. Low magnesium levels were also tied to faster subclinical
atherosclerosis and longer QT intervals [223].

Low magnesium levels are confirmed causes of arrhythmias and sudden death—fatal
events more common in athletes than in the general population. It is essential to prevent
magnesium deficiency and implement supplementation, if necessary, due to the increased
requirements in athletes.

3.3.4. Respiratory System

Bronchial asthma, often seen in athletes, involves airway narrowing and inflammation.
Respiratory issues, especially exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, are more common
in elite athletes (20–70% prevalence), with risk influenced by sport type, environment,
and genetics [224].

Magnesium deficiency, both in serum and cells,

is common in asthma
patients [225–227], exacerbating asthma symptoms [227–230]. Magnesium helps to re-
duce airway constriction through calcium antagonism, reduced neutrophil activity, and
cAMP modulation [231,232]. Low levels may worsen asthma by impairing neuromuscular
function and promoting bronchospasm [231].

Magnesium has been used to treat asthma since 1936 and is effective via IV or inhala-
tion in improving lung function and bronchodilation [225,227,229,233–236]. The MAG-
NETIC trial showed lasting benefits in children [237]. Magnesium may also modulate
immune responses and reduce asthma-related cytokines [238]. A recent review found that
two-thirds of studies reported that magnesium sulfate treatment improved asthma exacer-

bation, assessed by FEV(1)/PEF [239]. Magnesium is essential for vitamin D metabolism
(see below), and deficiency in both can worsen airway reactivity and infection risk [37,240].
The possibility that magnesium can prevent and treat asthma attacks has been studied.
There are no good-quality data in athletes, although this population could benefit, given
their higher risk of this disease.

4. Vitamin D and Magnesium Interactions

Notably, magnesium and vitamin D are closely linked—vitamin D aids magnesium
absorption, while magnesium is essential for vitamin D synthesis, transport, and ac-
tivation (Figure 3). Deficiency in magnesium can impair both vitamin D metabolism
and function [37].

Figure 3. Magnesium is required in the transport and activation of vitamin D. Vitamin D3 is produced
in the skin via UVB exposure acting on 7-dehydrocholesterol, followed by a heat-driven reaction.
Both skin- and diet-derived vitamin D (D3—cholecalciferol and D2—ergocalciferol, respectively) are
transported by DBP and converted in the liver to 25(OH)D (calcifediol), then further metabolized in
the kidneys (and other organs as needed) to the active hormone 1,25(OH)2D (calcitriol). Magnesium
serves as a cofactor for D2 and D3 binding to DBP, hepatic 25-hydroxylation, 25(OH)D transport,
and renal 1α-hydroxylation and 24-hydroxylation. Thus, all steps in vitamin D metabolism are
magnesium dependent. CYP: Cytochrome P450; DBP: vitamin D binding protein.

In addition, magnesium is vital for PTH synthesis and secretion, and low magnesium
levels can impair PTH and vitamin D function, creating a cycle that worsens both deficien-
cies [241–245]. This dual deficiency of vitamin D and magnesium is linked to increased
risk of fractures, especially in women [206]. This harmful interaction may contribute to
other health issues. Deng et al. found that higher magnesium intake was linked to a
lower risk of vitamin D deficiency and that the inverse link between vitamin D levels and
mortality from colorectal cancer and CVD was strongest in those with higher magnesium
intake [240]. Similarly, a double-blind RCT from the Personalized Prevention of Colorectal
Cancer Trial showed that optimal magnesium levels improved 25(OH)D levels, confirming
magnesium’s role in vitamin D metabolism [38]. Another study found that combined
vitamin D and magnesium deficiencies were linked to greater asthma severity and more
frequent exacerbations [226].

In a study of 192 British Olympic and Paralympic athletes, 22% showed cellular
magnesium deficiency, particularly among women, Black/Mixed ethnicity athletes, and

those with tendon pain, while higher levels were seen in throwers and Paralympians with
cerebral palsy [175].

Magnesium absorption declines with vitamin D deficiency [246], which is common in
athletes (see Section 2.2), especially Black athletes [247] due to reduced vitamin D synthesis
in darker skin [248]. Pollock et al. found lower red cell magnesium levels in Black and
Mixed Race athletes and in women [247], mirroring vitamin D deficiency trends [51]. These
findings suggest the need to monitor magnesium status in athletes with low vitamin
D levels [38].

Thus, magnesium and vitamin D are crucial for athletes, supporting energy, immunity,
and musculoskeletal health. Due to increased exercise demands, they may be prone to
magnesium and vitamin D deficiencies. Table 7 outlines key metabolic pathways affected
by magnesium and vitamin D in athletes.

Vitamin D intake is generally recommended in the range of 600 to 2000 IU/day by
international health agencies [6], although the optimal dose should be tailored to individual
status, best determined through blood testing. Athletes may be at higher risk of deficiency
due to factors such as indoor training (e.g., swimmers, gymnasts), darker skin tone, living
at high latitudes or during winter, and limited sun exposure from clothing or sunscreen use.
Blood levels of 25(OH)D should ideally be maintained between 30 and 50 ng/mL. Toxicity
is a concern when concentrations exceed 100 ng/mL, particularly in those consuming high
levels of calcium [64].

The recommended daily magnesium intake is 420 mg for men and 320 mg for women
in the U.S. adult population [249] and 350 mg for men and 300 mg for women in Eu-
rope [250]. Athletes may require 10–20% more due to increased losses (sweat, urine),
higher metabolic demands, and suboptimal dietary intake [29]. Key food sources in-
clude green vegetables, whole grains, legumes, pseudocereals, nuts, seeds, and cocoa,
avoiding conditions that may decrease bioavailability (Table 4). Magnesium supplements
(200–400 mg/day of elemental magnesium) are recommended when intake is insufficient
or deficiency symptoms persist. Although the signs of magnesium deficiency are often
nonspecific [11], suboptimal magnesium levels should be considered when persistent symp-
toms such as muscle cramps or spasms, fatigue, low endurance, irritability, poor sleep,
delayed recovery, or increased injury risk are present. The serum magnesium level may not
reflect cellular levels, but it will exclude severe deficiency [119].

5. Conclusions

Vitamin D and magnesium are essential elements for preserving the health of athletes
due to their key effects on musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and respiratory functions. These
elements are also essential for supporting athletic performance. Deficiencies in both of
these crucial compounds are common among athletes and can compromise their training
and physical performance, promote injuries (e.g., stress fractures), arrhythmias, sudden
cardiac death, asthma, and infections, as well as hinder proper recovery.

The evidence reviewed suggests that most athletes fail to meet the recommended
magnesium intake through diet alone and that they have higher requirements. Athletes are
also prone to vitamin D deficiency. There are no data on the presence of both deficiencies
simultaneously. There is also no definitive evidence on the possibility that supplementation
with these nutrients could have any effect on athletic performance, and there are no data on
the effects of their combination, given that they are closely related and mutually necessary
compounds. However, despite the lack of specific studies on these outcomes, it is clear
and prudent to ensure that athletes do not have deficiencies in these two fundamental
nutrients due to the relevant consequences, including stress fractures, sudden cardiac death,
and infections.

One-size-fits-all strategies, high dose or bolus administration, and overlooking per-
sonalized protocols are not recommended. Instead, it is necessary to attentively evaluate
and monitor the statuses of vitamin D and magnesium, advise following an adequate diet
and sun exposure throughout the year, and if necessary, use supplements to obtain and
maintain adequate levels of the two essential compounds for athletes’ health.

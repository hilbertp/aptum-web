Abstract: The aim of this systematic review is twofold: (i) to examine the effects of micronutrient
intake on athletic performance and (ii) to determine the speciﬁc micronutrients, such as vitamins, min-
erals, and antioxidants, that offer the most signiﬁcant enhancements in terms of athletic performance,
with the goal of providing guidance to athletes and coaches in optimizing their nutritional strategies.
The study conducted a systematic search of electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Web of Science,
Scopus) using keywords pertaining to micronutrients, athletic performance, and exercise. The search
involved particular criteria of studies published in English between 1950 and 2023. The ﬁndings
suggest that vitamins and minerals are crucial for an athlete’s health and physical performance, and
no single micronutrient is more important than others. Micronutrients are necessary for optimal
metabolic body’s functions such as energy production, muscle growth, and recovery, which are all
important for sport performance. Meeting the daily intake requirement of micronutrients is essential
for athletes, and while a balanced diet that includes healthy lean protein sources, whole grains, fruits,
and vegetables is generally sufﬁcient, athletes who are unable to meet their micronutrient needs
due to malabsorption or speciﬁc deﬁciencies may beneﬁt from taking multivitamin supplements.
However, athletes should only take micronutrient supplements with the consultation of a specialized
physician or nutritionist and avoid taking them without conﬁrming a deﬁciency.

Keywords: vitamins; minerals; sport; performance

Optimal performance is a primary objective for many athletes, and this can be attained
by following a suitable exercise protocol and ensuring proper nutrition [1]. Food is com-
posed of nutrients that are essential for growth, repair, and energy generation depending
on the amount that meets the body’s need [2]. Nutrients are typically categorized into two
main groups: micronutrients and macronutrients [3]. When it comes to athletic perfor-
mance, the importance of micronutrients should not be neglected [4]. Athletes are prone
to consuming insufﬁcient amounts of micronutrients due to inappropriate dietary habits,
especially if they are not matching their physical activity requirements [5]. By making
sure they are receiving adequate levels of micronutrients, athletes can give themselves a
competitive edge and maximize the potential of their training [6]. Micronutrients may

boost mental performance, help balance hormones, and keep cognitive performance at its
peak [7].

It is noteworthy to emphasize that sports nutrition is not a one-size-ﬁts-all solution, as
each athlete has speciﬁc nutritional needs [7]. Therefore, athletes, nutritionists, and coaches
must work together to customize nutritional plans for each athlete to ensure that their
athletes/players’ needs are considered properly and they are receiving the sufﬁcient level of
nutrients they need to aid in the adaptation to their training and ultimately support optimal
athletic performance. The evaluation of the evidence of the impact of micronutrients on the
performance of athletes is the main purpose of this comprehensive systematic review paper.

2. Methods and Search Strategy

A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the Web of Science, Scopus,
and PubMed databases. In order to retrieve relevant studies on the topic, our search strategy
incorporated keywords including “micronutrients”, “vitamins”, “minerals”,” antioxidants”,
“athletes”, “sport performance”, “training”, and “exercise”. Original research articles
involving human subjects, English-language publications, human subjects, and a focus on
micronutrients and athletic performance were the inclusion criteria. For the systematic
review procedure, the Synthesis without meta-analysis (SWIM) recommendations were
followed. The search was limited to articles published between January 1950 and 31 March
2023. The studies that made the cut for the review had to measure outcomes related to
athletic performance, have a sample size of at least 10 participants, and use an intervention
involving a micronutrient supplement. Studies that concentrated on macronutrients—such
as carbohydrates and protein—were disregarded.

2.1. Data Extraction

Studies’ titles and abstracts located by the search were examined by two independent
reviewers. After that, full-text articles were examined to see if they qualiﬁed for inclusion
in the review. Data on the study design, sample size, intervention protocol, micronutrient
supplements used, athletic performance outcomes assessed, and outcomes were extracted
from the eligible studies.

2.2. Data Synthesis

To summarize the conclusions of the included studies, a narrative synthesis was
carried out. The studies’ ﬁndings were categorized by micronutrient supplement and
athletic performance outcome measures. A description of each study’s design, sample
size, intervention strategy, and ﬁndings was included in the synthesis. It is important to
ensure the accuracy and reliability of a systematic review by ensuring that all information is
extracted in a standardized and consistent manner. In this study, two authors independently
extracted all information from each paper to minimize the risk of bias and errors. This
approach helps to ensure the validity of the review’s ﬁndings and strengthens the overall
quality of the study. By having two authors independently extract information from each
paper, the review can ensure data accuracy and increase conﬁdence in the conclusions
drawn from the analysis. It is a rigorous method that is commonly used in systematic
reviews and emphasizes the importance of transparency and objectivity in research [8].

3. Results

A total of 231 articles were obtained involving 18,683 athletes. Table 1 provides a
summary of the main micronutrients researched in sports medicine. Table 2 provides a
summary of all available 217 research articles about micronutrients and sports performance.
Figure 1 simpliﬁed the model of micronutrients’ main functions in sports medicine.

Vitamin k implies its anabolic
inﬂuence on the bone turnover in
several parts including, the
regulation of speciﬁc gene
transcription in osteoblasts,
osteoblast differentiation
initiation, and activating the
bone-associated vitamin

Vitamin A has an oxidation
potency which protects
athletes against induced and
intense exercise free radicals,
contributes to the elimination
of ROS, and prevents muscle
damage and the onset of
diseases, despite the higher
demand for vitamin A in
athletes.
Its deﬁciency is not directly
linked to performance
impairment, unlike other
micronutrients such as iron
and others [12].

Decreased performance,
recovery, immunity, and blood

Iron is a key component in a
variety of physiological functions
that impact athletes’ physical
performance.
Due to the number of
iron-dependent proteins and
enzymes affecting energy
production in mitochondria and
the oxygen delivered to the
muscles.
Oxygen-carrying capacity and
mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation activity, which
is determined by the hemoglobin
mass, skeletal muscle, and
maximal oxygen

Iron deﬁciency, whether
combined with anemia or not,
can lead to muscle impaired
function and limited
endurance capacity, which
affect athletic performance and
training adaptation
negatively [31].

Since calcium ion could move
through and out of a cell’s
cytoplasm, it has an essential role
in signaling for various process
in the cell, including muscle
contraction, exocytosis,
proliferation of action potentials
through cardiac muscle, and
neurotransmitter release [35]

Potassium is a major source of
energy for athletes. It helps to
reduce the amount of lactic acid
stored in the muscles, which can
lead to fatigue as well as
maintain a healthy metabolism.
Potassium is also involved in the
breakdown of carbohydrates,
which helps to keep energy levels
high during intense physical
activity [37]

Magnesium (Mg) is an important
mineral with an essential impact
on the human body. It plays a
crucial part in maintaining
proper muscle functioning and
energy metabolism; several
studies assessed the relation
between Mg
status/supplementation and
exercise performance and found
a direct correlation between
magnesium demand and raised
levels of physical activity [38]

Zinc has an advantageous effect
on performance improvement by
participating in muscle energy
production, recruiting fast twitch
muscle ﬁbers and protein
synthesis, which is necessary for
physical performance [40]

Selenium in glutathione
peroxidase aids in allergies and
inﬂammatory diseases
elimination, defending the
muscles and the cardiovascular
system [43]

Deﬁciency Effect on
Performance

Calcium plays a crucial role in
maintenance, growth
regulating muscle contraction,
normal blood clotting, and the
conduction of nerve and bone
tissue repair.
The possibility of stress
fracture and low bone-mineral
density is elevated by low
available levels of energy. In
certain cases, such as female
athletes, insufﬁcient calcium
intake combined with
menstrual dysfunction
increases the risk ratio [36]

Whole body and muscle
fatigue such as inappropriate
exercise performance could be
the result of the acute
depletion of the
trans-sarcolemma k+ [36]

Athletes who are insufﬁcient
in magnesium levels are not
protected from inﬂammatory
reactions, which may increase
the risk of hypertension,
atherosclerosis, diabetes
mellitus, osteoporosis, and
cancer occurrence [39]

Deﬁcient zinc levels in athletes
reduced endurance, led to a
signiﬁcant reduction in body
weight, and latened fatigue
with impaired endurance and
osteoporosis risk [41]

Insufﬁcient Se levels may raise
exercise-induced oxidative
stress over time [44]

Mn is an essential nutrient
necessary for energy metabolism
and in antioxidant enzymes that
protect cells from damage due to
free radicals [46]

The deﬁciency of manganese
was indicated as an etiological
agent in joint diseases and hip
abnormalities
development [45]

Only adolescents with a combination of sports
participation and higher serum concentrations of Vit
D showed better bone geometry, indicating the
relevance of the combination of both factors to
bone health.

Vit D may play a signiﬁcant role in cardiovascular
function that inﬂuences endothelial and smooth
muscle cell function. Vit D deﬁciency may increase
the risk of incident cardiovascular events after acute
exhaustive exercise, even in healthy and active adults.

Mineral-rich antioxidant supplements did not directly
affect oxidative stress markers in the blood but
suggested that performance (lactate) and salivary
nitric oxide could be improved.

Supplementing 50,000 IU of Vit D3 per week for six
weeks combined with six weeks of SIT may improve
markers of aerobic and anaerobic performance in
recreational male combat sport athletes.

The bioavailable Vit D concentration was associated
with a higher total, ap spine, and hip bone mineral
density (bmd), but the total Vit D concentration was
not related to total bmd and was negatively associated
with ap spine and hip bmd

Vit D3 supplementation in a dose of 6000 IU/d
increased its serum concentration in all the study
groups of young athletes, causing the equalization of
a suboptimal supply of Vit D3 in the serum.
The study was not able to prove the ability of Vit D3
supplemented in the proposed dose to inﬂuence IL-6
or CRP concentrations in athletes.

The association of Vits (C and E) with cryotherapy
attenuated the inﬂammatory response and pain,
favoring recovery after an acute resistance exercise
session.

The frequency of Vit D deﬁciency and insufﬁciency is
higher in indoor athletes and is especially associated
with the risk of bone injuries

Vit D insufﬁciency was associated with lower
maximal aerobic power, as assessed with a
standardized exhaustive cycling ergometer test.
The Vit D level was the only independent predictor of
maximal aerobic power in these athletes, highlighting
the impact of Vit D on physical performance.
A Vit D level of less than 30 ng/mL should be
maintained to ensure optimal physical performance in
these athletes.

Aerobic exercise combined with Vit D
supplementation can reduce serum inﬂammatory
factors and anti-inﬂammatory proteins and improve
lung function after four weeks of intervention.
The combination of aerobic exercise and Vit D
supplementation remarkably reduced TNF-α, IL-6,
and CC16.
Aerobic exercise alone and the combination of aerobic
exercise and Vit D supplementation signiﬁcantly
increased FEV1 and FVC.

Vit D supplementation of 25 µg/day signiﬁcantly
increased the serum Vit D level in elite male
collegiate athletes.
Vit D supplementation may play a role in maintaining
athletes’ body fat percentage under circumstances
where sports activity has decreased.

The osmolarity of consumed ﬂuids does not
signiﬁcantly affect the indicators of the
water–electrolyte balance and the acid–base balance
during exercises; such an effect is only noticeable after
consuming an isotonic drink.
The degree of mineralization of the water consumed
by female ﬁeld hockey players did not affect the
indicators of the water–electrolyte and acid–base
balance in the blood and urine.

Vit D is insufﬁciently widespread among indoor elite
athletes, with the majority of them suffering from Vit
D deﬁciency. Outdoor players had a sufﬁcient Vit
D level.
Vit D insufﬁciently had signiﬁcantly higher body fat
percentages than sufﬁcient Vit D athletes.

A maximum incremental test did not produce any
changes in plasma Vits in athletes.
However, it increased the levels of Vit C in
erythrocytes and decreased malondialdehyde values
in plasma and Vit E in erythrocytes.
The levels of malondialdehyde, Vit C, and Vit E were
related to performance parameters.

The prevalence of inadequacy for Vit D, calcium, Vit

higher in para-athletes.
The prevalence of the risk for iron deﬁciency was
recorded in female para-athletes.

Given the endurance adaptations from Vit D
supplementation and the importance of endurance for
combat performance, recreational combat athletes
should supplement at 50,000 IU per week for
six weeks.
There is no additional beneﬁt of increasing the dose
above 50,000 IU Vit D per week.

The plasma Vit D level is considered a signiﬁcant
indicator for reducing muscle cell damage induced by
eccentric exercise.

Serum Vit D was a poor predictor of exercise
performance, but it did moderate (with cortisol) the
testosterone link to muscle power.

Vit D supplementation may affect the muscle function
and health of the athlete.
It is recommended that Vit D levels should be checked
on an annual basis in all athletes for their health.

Eight weeks of TRX training with Vit D and calcium
supplementation improved BMI and HDL
serum levels.
The intensity and duration of training and
supplementation probably have positive effects on
lipids proﬁles.

Athletes with sufﬁcient Vit D achieved a higher
maximum systolic BP and a higher maximum
power output.
Better performance was recoded among athletes with
sufﬁcient Vit D.

Elite handball athletes showed a different expression
proﬁle in reference to key genes implicated in several
sports’ performance-related functions compared to
the sedentary controls, in addition to the modulation
of gene expression after multiVit/mineral
supplementation.

Professional handball athletes suffered from Vit D
insufﬁciency even in summer.
Their insufﬁciency level negatively impacted their
physical performance, which is a risk for
musculoskeletal injuries and infections.

Vit D insufﬁciency is common among elite athletes
engaged in synchronized swimming and swimmers.
It is accompanied by a decrease in ifn-γ, an increase
in tnf-α, IL-4, and IL-6 levels, and an elevation of urti
morbidity.
Seasonal monitoring and correction of the Vit D level
for the normalization of the cytokine proﬁle and a
decrease in urti morbidity is deﬁnitely advised

It is important to educate women about the necessity
to provide the body with proper calcium and Vit D
intake levels in a diet to avoid health problems,
resulting from the deﬁcit of the nutrients.

Correcting Vit D insufﬁciency improves some but not
all aspects of performance. Thus, the efﬁcacy of Vit D
supplementation to enhance performance
remains unclear.

Vit D insufﬁciency is highly prevalent in ice hockey
players, but the Vit D level was not associated with
exercise performance or indices of iron status.

The association between Vit D and iron status in
female athletes is complex, and it is challenging to
determine which nutrient exerts a stronger inﬂuence
over the other.

To maintain the optimal Vit status of the athlete’s
organism, it was inappropriate to use excessive doses
of Vits C (>200–300 mg/day), E (>50 mg TE/day), and
A (>1500 µg RE/day).

Minerals and trace elements from deep oceans possess
great promise in developing supplements to increase
the cerebral hemodynamic response against a physical
challenge and during post-exercise recovery for
middle-aged men.

A combination of micronutrients can improve aerobic
exercise performance in one set of circumstances.

Both users and non-users of nutritional supplements
reported inadequate intake of micronutrients.
For most micronutrients, the use of nutritional
supplements does not completely compensate for
intakes below recommendation.

A sufﬁcient Vit D concentration in summer did not
guarantee a sufﬁcient status in winter.
Coaches and medical professionals should monitor
athletes’ Vit D concentration regularly to prevent Vit
D deﬁciency.

Frequent low doses of Vit D intake and gradual
supplementation withdrawing were more preferable
than the opposite.

Vit D insufﬁciency is common in long-lasting sports.

Vit K2 supplementation had been reported to improve
cardiovascular function in diseased patients.

Vit D insufﬁciency and deﬁciency were common
among collegiate athletes, which affect their muscular
strength and power.
It is important to consider the beneﬁts of Vit D for
optimal training to maximize performance, especially
in muscular strength anaerobic power exercise.

There was an inverse correlation between BMI and
4000 IU of Vit D supplementation in athletes.
Normal-BMI athletes demanded less than the upper
limit of Vit D supplementation to sustain sufﬁcient Vit
D status.
High-bone-turnover athletes lost a signiﬁcant amount
of Vit D during training.

Polish elite athletes suffer from an insufﬁcient Vit D
status that affecst their health and performance
negatively, especially among indoor sports.
Hence, it is recommended to be exposed to sunlight
combined with an oral Vit D supplement.

To improve the pro-inﬂammatory circulating in young
athletes, functional beverage supplementation is
recommended during exercise.

Intake of 2200 IU/day of Vit D can recover the
deﬁciency among athletes.

Irish athletes recovered from Vit D insufﬁciency due
to supplementation program-targeted elite sports.

during winter, which could inﬂuence bone
mineralization over the three months.

Among elite indoor athletes who suffer from
insufﬁcient Vit D, a shot of 150,000 IU showed a
favorable impact on muscle function and Vit D level.

The intake of kona showed a positive impact on
exercise performance, especially when consumed
during the recovery strategy of rehydration and

The intake of Vit C at rest showed a positive effect on
reducing the oxidative stress, enhancing the
antioxidant capacity, and altering the redox state and

Among male athletes, no association was found
between Vit D and BMD and T-score.

Sunlight exposure in the summer combined with
everyday supplementation of 1000 iu in the winter is
the practical proposal to achieve Vit D sufﬁciency.

To improve respiratory infections resistance, it is
recommended that athletes consume a daily dose of
5000 IU Vit D supplement by monitoring the
expression of sIgA and Cathelicidins.

Among subjects who do not eat enough servings of
fruits and vegetables, the intake of Vits and minerals
supplements during exercise increased TAS,
improved resting expiratory ﬂow rates, and reduced
EFL during exercise.

Among young male ice hockey players, the Vit D level

Severe Vit D-deﬁcient athletes show signiﬁcantly
fewer cardiac structural parameters than insufﬁcient
and sufﬁcient athletes.

Athletes with a large body size and/or excess
adiposity may be at a higher risk for Vit D
insufﬁciency and deﬁciency.

Vit C supplementation can suppress the lipid
peroxidation process during exercise but cannot affect
the neutrophil inﬂammatory response in either
exercise group.

It is recommended among sport-active adolescents to
improve their intake with the dairy products “biﬁdin”
and “prolacta” hypoVitosis and micro-elementoses.

Intakes of 500 mg/day Vit C and 400 IU/day Vit E for

Throughout the skate treadmill gxt, the level of Vit D
was not signiﬁcantly assoiciated with any
physiological or physical parameter.

In young soccer players, the intake of Vit C combined
with exercise decreases TBARS-levels and may affect
the values of PLT, MPV, PCT, and RDW.

The concentration of Vit D was signiﬁcantly
associated with the pre- and post-experimental
performance parameters.

In non-exhaustive exercise, the intake of 250 mg Vit C
twice a day for 15 days had no impact on IL-6 and
IL-10, while it increased the production of IL-6 and
IL-10 during the 2 h post-exercise recovery.

Quercetin and Vit C supplementation may not be
beneﬁcial in lipid proﬁle improvement, although it
may reduce induced muscle damage and the body
fat percentage.

Vits C and E supplementation can be beneﬁcial in
reducing muscle damage indices during
aerobic exercises.

Vit D supplement is recommended during the winter
and early spring months to overcome insufﬁciency
in athletes.

Vit D deﬁciency is common among athletes; hence,
coaches are encouraged to recommend a stretching
warm-up routine in an outdoor setting during the
winter season speciﬁcally.

Neutrophils protein oxidation-induced exercise is
reduced due to Vit E and Vit C antioxidant
supplement intake proteins. Vit E and Vit C intake did
not alter the adaptive response of the antioxidant and
increased the gene expression of catalase and
glutathione peroxidase.

The performance reaction and endurance of lower
body muscles are enhanced signiﬁcantly after
consuming supplements pre-strenuous exercise.
Moreover, spare energy and reduced fatigue
delay fatigue.

In relation to a series of exhausting exercises, the risk
of hemorheological and exercise-induced death would
be prevented by antioxidant Vit treatment.

In prolonged exercise, high doses of Vit C with or
without carbohydrates were traced to a minor impact
on the hormonal, interleukin-6, or immune response.

Among recreational athletes, mma (methylmalonic
acid) was not associated with Vit B12 metabolism.

Carotenoids as exogenous antioxidants have
important protective roles and should be considered
by athletes.

To delay sport fatigue and lipid peroxidation after
hypoxia condition exercise, it is recommended to
consume acetazolamide, highland-Vit-tablets, and
redbull beverages.

No signiﬁcant difference between Vit E supplements

The activity of superoxide dismutase and catalase
antioxidant enzymes in neutrophils is enhanced by
antioxidant supplementation.

The immediate intake of Vit C and NAC supplement
after injury would have a negative effect on tissue
damage and oxidative stress.

Post-strenuous exercise, neutrophil dysfunction is
corrected due to the intake of Vit C supplement.

Long-term Vit C supplement intake would have a
reasonable and beneﬁcial impact on the recovery
phase due to the unusual exercise protocol.

Oestradiol protects from oxidative injury, more so
than Vit E. Both had no impact on exhausted
muscle performance.

The level of Vit C and Vit E is raised signiﬁcantly due
to the supplements intake, although its level does not
affect the immune indicators of cytokine, lymphocyte
responses, or muscle enzymes due to exercise.

Vit E intake, even not from supplements, would be
sufﬁcient to protect from the oxidative stress which is
yielded due to the moderate-intensity exercise.

The priority of Vit E intake is RBC protection against
oxidative damage. The sufﬁciency level of serum Vit E
promotes its shifting from the serum to a steady
RBC-α-tocopherol level due to exercise.

A minor increase in the antioxidant level when
athletes consume 500 mg of Vit C from fruits during
moderate/high-intensity endurance training;
however, it did not balance the oxidative stress.
Athletes who engage in long-term endurance-training
would beneﬁt from Vit C extracted from fruit.

Vit E supplementation had an insufﬁcient impact on
plasma lipid peroxidation after exercise.

Calcium and iron supplementation are commonly
consumed by females, while males consume Vit B12
and Vit A supplements.
There were some variations in the Vit/mineral
supplement habits of the athletes by gender, ethnicity,
and sport.

Through intensive endurance exercise, Vit B6
supplementation can alter plasma FFA and amino
acid levels.

Subjects who are at risk of Vit deﬁciency or highly
demanding would beneﬁt from supplements intake.

Higher calcium intakes promote some beneﬁt to bone
mineral density.

Vit C supplementation for 1 day/2 weeks reduces the
oxidative stress induced by exercise.

Endurance performance is not improved by ﬁsh oil
supplements. Due to the increase in oxidative stress
post-endurance exercise, ﬁsh oil may act as
an antioxidant.

assess Vit/mineral supplement use by adolescents
and to provide education and counseling about diet,

The use of Vit E resulted in a decrease in the energy

changes in blood and erythrocyte membrane lipid
composition and blood calcium ion concentration.

Vit E intake did not reduce the lung clearance

There was a reduction in the loss of contractile
function post-eccentric exercise and in the ﬁrst 24 h of
recovery in the group supplemented with Vit C but
not Vit E. Prior supplementation with Vit C can
attenuate eccentric exercise-induced muscle damage.
It is proposed that the effect of Vit C supplementation
on contractile function, particularly LFF, could be to
protect vital cell structures such as the SR from

4. Vitamins

Vitamins are organic essential compounds that cannot be synthesized by the human
body [29]. They play a vital role in numerous functions that are relevant to the athlete’s
performance [7]. Their functions are evident in co-enzymes, hormones, and autoxidation,
as well as their contribution to energy production [242]. There are thirteen various kinds
of vitamins currently divided into two major groups due to their chemical and biological
functions, four of which are fat-soluble vitamins (FSV) including vitamins A, D, E, and K,
and the rest are water-soluble vitamins (WSV) including B complex vitamins and vitamin
C [243]. Table 1 summarizes the recommendation requirements of vitamins along with the
rich sources and their roles in exercise performance.

5. Fat-Soluble Vitamins (FSV)
Vitamin A

Vitamin A plays a signiﬁcant role in promoting the overall wellbeing of athletes, as it
aids in the formation of healthy tissues and improves oxygen access throughout the body,
thereby supporting the maintenance of an adequate level of physical activity [3]. It also has
a crucial inﬂuence on vision, skin health, and immune system functioning [29]. Moreover,
vitamin A is a potent antioxidant that helps in neutralizing free radicals generated by
oxidative stress during advanced physical training. The sufﬁcient consumption of vitamin
A may help alleviate the reactive oxygen species and avoid the onset of illnesses such as
heart failure and muscle damage [244], as mentioned in many studies in Table 2.

Vitamin A mainly exists in two forms: animal source (retinol) and plant-based provita-
min A (carotenoids). The intake of sufﬁcient amounts of beef liver, eggs, dairy products,
and seafood as well as dark leafy green vegetables may ensure meeting the dietary require-
ments for athletes. It is noteworthy that athletes may beneﬁt from supplementation with
multivitamins that contain vitamin A, as a part rather than its own sole use [29].

Sports 2023, 11, 109

17 of 42

Vitamin A has been proved to enhance and support various body functions, including
reaction time, muscles recovery [245,246], and protein synthesis, which is essential for
muscle growth and recovery and can be important for those competing in events requiring
fast reﬂexes [247]. Furthermore, vitamin A can help protect athletes against injuries by
increasing healing times and promoting the formation of healthy connective tissues [3].
Finally, vitamin A may help ﬁght off colds, ﬂu, and other illnesses, which can be particularly
helpful for traveling athletes.

To evaluate the effect of crocetin on fatigue, a study test was conducted by athletes to
measure stamina using a bicycle ergometer at a standard workload for 120 min twice. They
also performed non-workload tests of 10 s at 30 min at a maximum velocity (MV) [242]. A
difference in MV from 30 to the 210 min test was remarkably reported only in men who
consumed crocetin when compared to their counterpart who used a placebo (p < 0.05) [248].
No difference was observed with the consumption of ascorbic acid in all candidates with
the same period [248]. The daily consumption of crocetin would reduce physical exhaustion
in men, according to these results [179]. The attenuating effect of saffron carotenoids on
muscle fatigue is due to their provitamin A activity [248]. Athletes should meet their daily
recommended intake of vitamin A to guarantee a perfect peak physical condition [249].

The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of retinol activity equivalents (mcg
RAE), as shown in Table 1, is 900 micrograms for men aged 19 years old and older, equal to
3000 international units (IU), and 700 mcg RAE for women aged 19 years old and older,
equivalent to 2333 (IU). However, the adherence to a maximum Tolerable Upper Limit (UL)
of 10,000 IU (3000 mcg)/day for adults is important to avoid any dangerous effect. It is
also important to emphasize that toxicity may occur when frequent doses of more than
25,000 IU are taken daily [3].

β-carotene is a member of the carotenoid family that is thought to provide numer-
ous health beneﬁts, including immunity system boosting, antioxidation properties, and
performance enhancement [250]. β-carotene is an essential antioxidant, meaning that it
helps prevent the harmful effect of free radicals on cells [251]. This is important for ath-
letes, as free radicals are generated during strenuous exercise and can lead to fatigue and
soreness [176]. Several studies have reported similar ﬁndings, highlighting the ability of
vitamin A to potentially reduce recovery time from exercise [7,250]

Sumac juice drink was tested in a study to evaluate its impact on pain scores through
post-exercise intervals. Forty healthy candidates involved in an aerobic training protocol
for four weeks received a dose of placebo or sumac juice consumption two times/day
for a month. The results revealed that participants of the sumac juice group had a lower
pain score increment and even a better enhancement during pain relief. The potency of
protecting muscles might be due to the sumac juice antioxidant potency of β-carotene-
linoleic acid components. These results highlight the possibility of sumac juice consumption
in improving muscle performance among athletes [252]. Nevertheless, future studies of
athletes are warranted.

Athletes often push their bodies to the limit, therefore compromising their immune
systems and making them more susceptible to infections and illness [176]. Taking a sup-
plement with β-carotene may have potential beneﬁts for the immune system, helping
to prevent illness and potentially enabling athletes to train harder and longer [250,251].
Apparently healthy nonsmoker adult males were involved in consuming placebo or 15
mg/day of β-carotene for 26 days. After oral administration, signiﬁcant increases in the
monocytes percentage representing the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule
human leukocyte antigen DR isotype (HLA-DR) and the adhesion molecules intercellular
adhesion molecule-1 and leukocyte function-associated antigen-3 were observed. Further-
more, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) was notably elevated due to the dose intake,
arguing that a slight increment in the consumption of dietary β-carotene can enhance the
responses of immune cells within the short term, supporting the process of the carcinogenic
potency [253].

Sports 2023, 11, 109

18 of 42

Lastly, β-carotene has been found to improve physical performance [254]. Studies
have shown that β-carotene supplementation may lead to endurance strength improvement
and injury risk prevention [3,150]. Similarly, a meta-analysis of nine studies including
participants from both genders, with a total 190,545 candidates, emphasized that β-carotene
leads to a signiﬁcant enhancement in overall performance [29]. There was a 95% possibility
that β-carotene consumption attenuates the possibility of hip fracture and other different
fracture types by over 20% [251]. According to research, despite the uncertain effect of
the antioxidant’s supplementation, consuming β-carotene and combining antioxidants or
not still has an effective impact in reducing exercise-induced peroxidation [33]. This may
enhance athletes’ endurance in the long term [251,254,255].

6. Vitamin E

As research progresses, the potential advantages of vitamin E for athletes are becoming
increasingly apparent. Vitamin E helps in protecting athletes’ bodies and may improve
both performance and recovery [75]. Overtraining and intense exercise are associated
with reactive oxygen species (ROSs) production, which aids in enhanced muscular and
endurance adaptation to exercise through the upregulation of endogenous antioxidant
enzymes [256]. However, excess accumulation of ROS accompanied by the inability of
the body to scavenge these compounds is harmful to the body’s cell components which is
associated with fatigue, delayed recovery, and reduced performance [257]. Accordingly,
research suggests the possible protective effects of vitamin E supplements against chronic
stress associated with exercise [257,258]. This vitamin possesses antioxidant properties by
neutralizing free radicals, protecting cells and tissues [257,258].

Studies showed controversial results of vitamin E supplementation in athletes [44]. It
was shown that vitamin E supplements neither inhibit exercise-induced oxidative stress nor
impact endurance running performance [259]. Moreover, these results were supported by
the randomized controlled trial on athletic students where vitamin E oral consumption was
found to not inﬂuence exercise endurance [260]. On the other hand, among healthy indi-
viduals, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) consumption inhibits the exercise-induced reduction
in blood paraoxonase 1/arylesterase activity [6,44,147,260]. Excess doses of supplements
have been shown in studies to inhibit the signaling reactions required for adaptations to
exercise, creating an interference effect [3].

A meta-analysis revealed that vitamin E supplements have a beneﬁcial and protective
effect, particularly at low doses (≤500 IU/day), in reducing biomarkers associated with
exercise-induced muscle damage and oxidative stress. Beneﬁcial effects of the antioxidant
characteristics of vitamin E were observed among exercise-induced side-effects [257]; both
animal and human studies have indicated that Vitamin E has the potential to enhance
immune function and provide protection against various infectious diseases [6]. Vitamin
E reduces PGE2 production and inhibits COX2 activity, likely by decreasing nitric oxide
production [261]. Furthermore, it improves T cells immune synapse formation and ac-
tivation signals, and lastly, it helps in modulating the T (Th1/Th2) balance [52]. This is
particularly beneﬁcial for athletes, who are often susceptible to illness and injury due to
the intense physical demands of their sport. By supplementing with vitamin E, athletes
can help increase the body’s natural immunity, thus reducing the risk of infection and
promoting recovery [262].

Vitamin E may assist in improving blood ﬂow, which is essential for athletes [242].
γ-tocopherol, which is one of the compounds that contain vitamin E, increases cardiovas-
cular functions. γ-tocopherol expands the activity of nitric oxide synthase, which in turn
produces nitric oxide, aiding in vessels relaxation and thus improving blood ﬂow [29].
Adequate levels of nutrients and oxygen concentrations in muscles indicate a raised blood
ﬂow rate, which may help improve performance [263]. Additionally, vitamin E improves
red blood cells’ ﬂow and ﬂexibility [264]. This is important for athletes, as improved blood
ﬂow means better performance in delivering nutrients and oxygen to the muscles, allowing
them to perform at their best [176].

Sports 2023, 11, 109

19 of 42

Free radicals such as superoxide, nitric oxide, and hydrogen peroxide are known to
be of signiﬁcant importance, as there must be a balance between antioxidants and free
radicals in order to obtain physiological muscle adaptation in response to exercise [25].
Few studies suggested that antioxidants supplementation may be beneﬁcial under spe-
ciﬁc circumstances, such as overtraining, high-altitude training, or hypoxic training, and
claimed that antioxidant usage such as the intake of vitamin E or vitamin C may have no
beneﬁt at all or may even cause harm [6,7,29,176,256]. Misusing or consuming excessive
amounts of vitamins can lead to muscle fatigue and impede the recovery process due to the
inactivation of the gene expression regulator Nrf2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor
2), which plays a role in the response to cellular stress and contributes to enhancing exercise
performance [265]. It is worth noting that Vitamin E toxicity may cause increases in mortal-
ity risk factors, since there has been a positive relation accompanied by a high-sensitivity C
reactive protein indicative of inﬂammation [266].

7. Vitamin D

Vitamin D plays a cooperative role in the synthesis of various hormones in the body [3].
Dairy products, egg yolk, and fatty ﬁsh are the rich dietary intake sources [2]. Moreover, it
can be synthesized in vivo and be activated by sunlight within a duration of 15 to 20 min of
exposure [44]. It also plays an important role in calcium homeostasis and constant healthy
bone [30], functions of improving the immune system, musculoskeletal system, power, and
force output [45].

Vitamin D supplementation has been increased among athletes [45]. Unfortunately,
the widespread vitamin D insufﬁciency has been clearly stated in elite male athletes, with
evidence of a deﬁcit in women [46]. Percentages of insufﬁciency in elite athletes were
above 50%, and the deﬁciency in other studies was 70–90%, as reported by Harju et al. [47].
Certain circumstances impact vitamin D status, such as indoor training, pigmented skin,
and living in a high-altitude region [48]. Studies have reported that athletes with vitamin
D deﬁciency may experience ergogenic beneﬁts when taking vitamin D supplements [103].
There was a direct relation between the concentrations of vitamin D and athletes’ per-
formance, such as speed, jumps’ height, power muscle tone, and strength of handgrip [50].
Moreover, the addition of calcium to vitamin D supplements exhibited a reduction in the
stress fracture rate [106,138].

In a study conducted among 70 athletes randomly assigned for 8 weeks to either
vitamin D oral supplements of 50,000 IU/week group or a control group, a signiﬁcant im-
provement in the test of the strength leg press in both groups was reported [267]. However,
the results emphasized that the enhancement in the supplemented group was obviously
more noted than that in the control group (p = 0.034). Moreover, when the sprint test was
conducted, within-group enhancement had been noticed in the supplemented group only
(p = 0.030). The results showed that regular weekly vitamin D supplementation with a dose
of 50,000 IU increased the levels of circulating calcidiol (major circulating form of vitamin
D) by approximately 17 ng/mL. This increment was related to a notable enhancement in
sprint and power leg examinations in the vitamin D group [138]

Additionally, vitamin D is also thought to improve the body’s utilization of carbo-
hydrates during exercise, providing the body with increased energy, which can help to
enhance performance [1]. Twenty-two male adult athletes were allocated into two groups
for 8 days: a one-shot dose of 150,000 IU vitamin D group and a placebo group. The vitamin
D group showed a signiﬁcant elevation in muscle power in the period from day 1 up to day
8, suggesting that a single dose of 150 000 IU vitamin D had a beneﬁcial impact on serum
25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D) levels and the muscle’s role [268].

To maintain sufﬁcient vitamin D levels, the most appropriate way is to spend time
in outdoor direct sunlight for several minutes each day, as obviously indicated by many
studies’ conclusions (see Table 2). This prescription for sun exposure should also be
combined with foods that are rich in vitamin D, such as dairy products, fatty ﬁsh, and
fortiﬁed foods [101]. Additionally, athletes may also beneﬁt from daily multivitamin

Sports 2023, 11, 109

20 of 42

supplements that contain vitamin D to ensure that their body receives the best possible
nutrition. The recommended daily dose of vitamin D, as shown in Table 1, varies depending
on age; a daily dose of 600 IU (equivalent to 15 micrograms (mcg)) is considered sufﬁcient
for the age of 19 and above in both genders, and for adults over 70 years old, an 800 IU
(20 mcg) daily dose would be sufﬁcient [7,25]. Vitamin D-deﬁcient athletes would require
50,000 IU of vitamin D per week for 8 weeks [138,258].

A previous study was conducted for 12 weeks among 53 youth athlete swimmers
who suffered from insufﬁcient levels of vitamin D to evaluate the inﬂuence of vitamin D
oral supplementation on physical performance by taking 2000 IU/day of vitamin D or
placebo. No notable difference was observed in performance between the supplemented
and placebo groups [269]. The results concluded that there was no remarkable correlation
found between Vitamin D levels and the evaluated criteria including strength or swimming
performance and even the age-adjusted balance. Although the oral administration of
vitamin D had raised the concentration of Vitamin D compared to the placebo group, no
signiﬁcant physical performance enhancement was reported [269].

8. Vitamin K

Vitamin K is essential for blood coagulation [163]. It may also impact bone metabolism
in postmenopausal women, according to a few previous studies [3,7,270]. In elite female
athletes, the oral intake of vitamin K at a dose of 10 mg/day has been shown to improve
bone remodeling [254] by increasing the calcium-binding capacity of osteocalcin, promoting
bone formation, and reducing bone resorption [176]. Moreover, the intake of vitamin K
improved cardiovascular function [18,231]. Table 1 summarized the recommendation and
the role of vitamin K in exercise performance.

9. Water-Soluble Vitamins (WSV)
Vitamin B

B-complex vitamins are essential for athletes to maintain optimal health and perfor-
mance [19]. B-complex vitamins help athletes manage stress and anxiety, aid in muscle
recovery, and reduce fatigue, which may adversely affect performance if left unchecked [2].
B-complex vitamins help in blood pressure regulation [271]. Moreover, B-complex vitamins
aid in maintaining a healthy sleep schedule by regulating levels of the sleep-regulating
hormone melatonin, helping athletes fall in a deep continuous sleep [5]. This is essential for
athletes, as the lack of sleep can affect an athlete’s performance [52]. B-complex vitamins
also contribute to maintaining optimal health and performance in athletes, supporting
improved brain functioning, concentration, sleep quality, and energy levels [19]. Thus,
athletes need to ensure that they are receiving enough vitamin B through their diet or
supplements [244].

Thiamine (B1) is a water-soluble vitamin that must be consumed regularly from the
diet [6]. Although free thiamine is stable at acidic pH, it is destroyed by ultraviolet (UV)
and gamma irradiation and is heat-sensitive [29]. Whole grains, bread, and nuts are the
most common thiamine food sources, while milled wheat ﬂour, polished rice, vegetables,
and fruits contain less thiamin [272]. The large intestine’s bacteria in the human body are
able to produce thiamine and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) [52]. Thiamine leaches into
the water due to its solubility and is inevitably lost in any discarded soaking or cooking
water, as well as destroyed by heating during culinary methods [7].

Thiamine, in its active state (TPP), is a cofactor of numerous important enzymes in-
volved in the metabolism of carbohydrates and branched-chain amino acids [7]. Moreover,
it is necessary for several other cellular functions, including the development of nucleic acid
precursors, myelin, and neurotransmitters (such as acetylcholine), as well as antioxidant
defense [272]. A deﬁciency of this vitamin leads to a decline in oxidative metabolism [265].
The biochemical outcomes include a failure to create adenosine triphosphate (ATP), lactic
acidosis resulting in a greater lactic acid generation, and a reduction in neurotransmit-
ter synthesis (e.g., acetylcholine, glutamate, aspartate, and gamma-aminobutyric acid

Sports 2023, 11, 109

21 of 42

(GABA)) [6]. The major causes of thiamin deﬁciency are either the insufﬁcient intake, poor
absorption or metabolism, or an increase the body demand [265]. Furthermore, diuretics
and diarrhea lead to thiamine deﬁciency [272]. Regarding thiamin and exercise, research
suggests that thiamin availability in the diet appears to inﬂuence exercise capacity when
athletes consume the recommended amount [254].

Riboﬂavin (B2) is the second vitamin from the B-complex vitamins [270]. It appears
as a yellow-orange chemical molecule that is water-soluble [273]. Riboﬂavin is relatively
heat- and oxygen-stable, especially in an acidic environment [19]. It is very light-sensitive,
destroyed by reducing agents, and unstable in alkaline solutions [4]. Riboﬂavin is essential
and must be obtained from food sources [2]. Riboﬂavin is abundant in almonds, beef liver,
sardines, mushrooms, cheddar cheese, and eggs [271]. When athletes consume a typical
amount of riboﬂavin, their exercise capability would be optimum [254].

Niacin (B3) is the third water-soluble member of the B vitamins family [176]. Humans
can partially convert the essential amino acid tryptophan to nicotinamide, which is a dietary
supply of niacin [270]. However, the conversion cannot meet the demands for niacin, so
dietary niacin supplies around 50% of the daily niacin requirement [256]. Meat, whole
grains, milk, and dairy products are good sources of niacin [242]. Niacin is abundant in
peanuts, seafood, mushrooms, and yeasts [29]. Food items high in tryptophan-containing
proteins, such as milk, cheese, and eggs, are good sources of niacin [7]. Its roles include
reduction and oxidation (redox) processes, as well as acting as a ligand for a range of purine
receptors [243].

It is hypothesized that this vitamin lowers cholesterol, improves thermoregulation,
and improves oxidative metabolism [274]. In hypercholesteremic individuals, a niacin
intake of 100–500 mg/day may help lower blood lipid levels while increasing homocys-
teine levels [176]. Nevertheless, consuming 280 mg of niacin during exercise has been
demonstrated to reduce exercise capacity by moderating fatty acid mobilization [275].

Pantothenic acid (B5) is a water-soluble vitamin that is widely available in the diet [3].
It is often provided as calcium pantothenate, which is more stable against light, heat,
and oxygen, but is unstable in both alkaline and acidic circumstances [273]. Sodium
pantothenate is also available, but its use is restricted due to its hygroscopicity [272].
Pantothenic acid functions as a coenzyme for acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA), implying its
importance in aerobic or oxygen-based energy systems [2]. Acetyl CoA supplementation
has not been shown to increase aerobic performance in studies [25,52,202,276]. Yet, one
study found a reduction in the lactic acid buildup, but no beneﬁt in performance was
concluded [277].

Pyridoxine (B6) is marketed as a supplement that increases muscular growth, strength,
and aerobic capacity in the lactic acid and oxygen systems [141]. It might additionally
have a relaxing effect, which has been related to increased mental power [24]. Surprisingly,
research showed that pyridoxine did not increase the capacity of aerobic exercise or the
accumulation of lactic acid in well-nourished athletes [23]. However, when paired with
vitamins B1 and B12, it has been shown to raise serotonin levels and enhance motor
abilities, which are required in sports such as pistol shooting and archery [24]. Moreover,
vitamin B6, thiamin, and pantothenic acid showed inverse relationships with stress risk
and anxiety [25]. Another study revealed that after a month of vitamin B6 intake, young
adult athletes reported feeling less anxiety [25]. Table 2 presents studies that investigated
the effect of vitamin B6 intake either as part of a multivitamin supplement or as a sole
intake on exercise performance. Most of the studies reported a positive impact on exercise
performance, particularly in cases of vitamin B6 deﬁciency.

Cyano-cobalamin (B12) is a coenzyme required for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) and serotonin [176]. In theory, it would enhance muscular mass and blood
oxygen-carrying capacity and lessen anxiety [273]. However, no ergogenic impact has been
documented in well-nourished athletes [242]. Interestingly, it may enhance pistol shooting
performance due to the stimulation of serotonin production, which reduces anxiety [2].
A cross-sectional research work studied 100 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)

Sports 2023, 11, 109

22 of 42

patients characterized by low-normal and high-normal vitamin B12 levels, who were
then enrolled in an Auditory Verbal Learning test to evaluate their memory’s function.
The results showed that those with low-normal B12 concentrations had notable defects
in learning and recognition abilities and even in memory performance due to the low
microstructure integrity of the hippocampus [23]. It is important to acknowledge that
vitamin B12 is crucial for proper brain functioning, as it aids in faster information processing
and enhances concentration levels [21]. This has been demonstrated in patients with
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who had low-normal levels of vitamin B12 [262]. This
is especially important for athletes, as improved brain functioning may help improve
performance in many ways, from learning new techniques to continuous focus maintenance
during long competitions [24].

Folic acid (folate) is a coenzyme that aids in the synthesis of DNA and red blood
cells [278]. An increased red blood cell count enhances oxygen supply to muscles during
exercise [21,79]. It is thought to be crucial in preventing birth abnormalities and may lower
homocysteine levels, which is a risk factor for heart disease [22]. Folic acid supplements did
not increase exercise performance among malnourished athletes with folate deﬁciency [254].

10. Vitamin C

Vitamin C (also known as ascorbic acid) can be found in many types of food, including
oranges, strawberries, broccoli, and sweet potatoes [15]. Athletes require more vitamin C
than the average person since their bodies are working harder and being pushed to the
limits [15,279]. Therefore, they need to receive enough of this vital nutrient to perform
at their best. Researchers have reported that the intake of vitamin C supplements does
not boost physical performance in well-nourished athletes [52]. Nevertheless, athletes are
recommended to receive an adequate amount of vitamin C from their balanced diet.

The crucial role of vitamin C in neutralizing free radicals has been raised from its
antioxidative potency [69], thereby improving the immune system [15] and reducing the
risk of illnesses such as colds and other viruses [280]. It plays an important role in immunity
by enhancing the differentiation and proliferation of B and T lymphocytes and increasing
antibodies levels [25]. Furthermore, vitamin C has been reported to modulate cytokine
production and decrease histamine levels [169,281]. Studies have also shown that vitamin
C can eliminate fatigue, improve coordination, and increase endurance [15].

Vitamin C has a crucial role to play in wound healing and collagen production [3]. It
helps boost energy levels and protects the body from illnesses and injuries [242]. Vitamin C
works as a co-factor to produce collagen for the propyl and lysol hydroxyls enzymes, which
stabilize the structure of collagen [29]. Furthermore, vitamin C also enhances collagen gene
expression in ﬁbroblasts [7], contributing to the strength and integrity of joints and muscles,
which is essential for the success of any athlete. This is supported by the fact that vitamin
C is crucial in protecting against ROS damage, enhancing keratinocyte differentiation, lipid
synthesis, ﬁbroblast proliferation, and migration, which has been seen to shorten the time
of wound healing [28,282].

However, high levels of vitamin C can, in turn, act as a pro-oxidant rather than an an-
tioxidant [29]. The overconsumption of vitamin C supplement decreases exercise-induced
adaptation, delays post-exercise recovery, increases lipid peroxidation, and diminishes
mitochondrial biogenesis [127]. These effects can hinder skeletal muscle adaptation to
exercise [3].

11. Minerals

Numerous physiological and metabolic processes in the human body involve min-
erals [283]. Minerals have physiological effects on the body during exercise, including
maintaining a normal heartbeat, oxygen transportation, antioxidation activity, healthy
bone, and immune system enhancement [283]. Sufﬁcient levels of minerals are required
for optimal performance because many of these processes are enhanced during sports
activity [284]. For athletes to perform at their best, maintaining a healthy body necessitates

Sports 2023, 11, 109

23 of 42

the intake of a variety of nutrients. Some minerals make weightlifting more effective by
enhancing athletic performance; these are the minerals that degrade faster when used in
sports endeavors [285] and thus need to be replaced routinely among athletes to sustain
their performance. Table 1 summarized the recommendation requirements of minerals
along with the rich sources and their roles in exercise performance.

12. Iron

Iron (Fe) is a crucial mineral for physical performance, and its importance cannot be
overstated [286]. When it comes to peak performance, an adequate intake of iron can make
all the difference [149]. It helps the body produce red blood cells, which are necessary for
transporting oxygen to the muscles [71]. Without enough iron, athletes and other physically
active individuals may suffer from fatigue and lethargy as the body struggles to meet the
increased demands [71]. A huge part of the pool of plasma iron (almost 80%) is utilized
by the bone marrow; this is equivalent to a 20–30 mg/day dose to ensure the efﬁcient
production of erythrocyte [31].

In addition to red blood cells production,

iron is also important for energy
metabolism [31]. It is necessary for converting food into energy, and it helps to ensure
that the body can use energy efﬁciently for physical activities [280]. Iron also helps the
body in regulating its temperature, making it an essential nutrient for athletes competing
in warm climates or hot weather [149]. Finally, it is important for other bodily functions,
such as the immune system, growth, and hormone production [284]. When considering
physical performance, it is important to ensure that iron intake is adequate and balanced.
The human physiological mechanism preserves the maximum iron [29]. Based on the
total compulsory iron depletion that occurs daily and the average of 10% absorption and
bioavailability, the World Health Organization (WHO) and other national institutes have
estimated iron-recommended doses depending on several characteristics including gender,
age, and race. The recommended dietary intake for females is 18 mg, and for males, it is
8 mg [31]. Poorly planned diets, coupled with inadequate levels of exercise, can lead to
anemia and other problems associated with low iron levels [286]. This may cause fatigue,
poor performance, and a decreased ability to perform physical activities [285]. Therefore, it
is necessary to consume a high-quality variant diet that involves iron-rich sources [284].

It is also important to make sure that athletes have enough time to rest and recover
between workouts.
Iron helps to replenish energy stores and reduce fatigue, so it is
important to give the body time to absorb the nutrient [287]. Additionally, certain sup-
plements may also help in providing additional iron to meet the demands of physical
performance [205]. Athletic training can result in alterations including higher vasculariza-
tion (creation of new blood vessels), elevated hematocrit, and higher erythrocyte awareness
in the blood, which may lead to an increase in iron needs [122]. A shortage of iron may
result from hemorrhages, gastric blood loss, and/or urinary tract bleeding, especially
among high-intensity sports [121]. Professionals are predicted to have 70% higher iron
needs than non-professionals [287]. Iron deﬁciency anemia can impede progress in an
athlete’s training by reducing oxygen delivery [283]. Lastly, most research concluded that
iron supplements do not enhance aerobic performance, unless there is a speciﬁc depletion
and/or anemia reported [149].

13. Calcium

Athletes must be in peak physical condition to perform at their best and make sure
their diets are balanced, which is an important part of their training regimen [288]. Calcium
(Ca) is among the many nutrients that athletes need to remain healthy [289]. It not only
helps to keep bones and muscles strong, but it has also been linked to improved perfor-
mance in athletes [32]. However, insufﬁcient Ca consumption and elevated Ca depletion
may expose a person to osteoporosis [194]. Athletes should make sure to consume an ade-
quate amount of Ca each day as part of their balanced diet, which would achieve around
1500 mg/d [32,188]. The optimal Ca requirement is 1200 mg/day for adolescents and youth,

Sports 2023, 11, 109

24 of 42

1000 mg/day for females aged 25 to 50 years old, and 1500 mg/day for postmenopausal
females who are not treated with estrogen replacement therapy [33]. With the right diet
and exercise routine, they may capitalize on the beneﬁts that Ca has to offer and maximize
their performance [32,188].

Numerous studies have indicated that the adequate and consistent consumption of Ca
can potentially enhance physical performance in athletes [289], as it plays a crucial role in
maintaining muscle strength, which is a key element for exercise performance [35,289]. Ad-
ditionally, it may help reduce injuries and improve recovery time [32]. It is also known that
Ca may protect the bones and joints from stress caused by continuous physical activity [32].
Conversely, improving Ca status with 2000 mg of Ca supplementation has been shown to
reduce the risk of developing a stress fracture [289]. Calcium also helps to convert carbohy-
drates and fat into energy, which can contribute to performance improvement [78,288]. It
also helps in reducing fatigue and delaying the onset of muscle soreness [290].

Calcium can be found in many common foods including milk, yogurt, cheese, and dark
leafy greens. Other sources include tofu, nuts, ﬁsh, and fortiﬁed cereals [289]. Additionally,
athletes may consider Ca supplements if they are unable to receive the recommended
daily intake from their diet. It is important to note that the amount of Ca an athlete
needs daily may vary depending on their weight and activity level [289]. Skeletal muscles’
ability to contract and relax depends in part on Ca [291]. The importance of it binding to
troponin C for the contraction of muscles has the potential to inﬂuence performance [33].
While it is true that training leads to higher Ca loss, primarily through perspiration, the
foundations of bone mineralization are Ca, vitamin D, and physical activity [292]. However,
in rare circumstances, especially if the diet is low in its nutrient density, physical activity
might endanger bones [65]. Every athlete should place a high priority on developing
and maintaining optimal bone health, since vigorous physical activity increases the stress
fractures risk [85,188].

14. Potassium

When it comes to athletes’ health and performance, one mineral that is essential to
success is potassium (K) [293]. It is a required nutrient for human health and is necessary
for many physiological processes [293]. Adults should not exceed the consumption of
2000 mg sodium/day (Na) or 5 g of salt and have a minimum dose of 3510 mg potas-
sium/day, according to new guidelines established by the WHO [14,281]. It has a crucial
role in muscle contractions and helps the body regulate ﬂuid balance, blood pressure, and
the heart rate [281]. In addition to its role in muscle contractions, it is also involved in nerve
functions and proper electrolyte balance [59], which may be beneﬁcial to athletes who may
be sweating during a long practice or game [29]. Furthermore, proper potassium levels can
help prevent injuries and help athletes maintain their energy levels [177,230].

Potassium is a great source of energy for athletes [293]. It helps to reduce the amount
of lactic acid stored in the muscles [59], which may lead to fatigue as well as maintain a
healthy metabolism [35]. It is also involved in the breakdown of carbohydrates, which helps
keep energy levels high during intense physical activity [177]. It is unknown if potassium
supplementation reduces the occurrence of muscular cramping in athletes. It should be
acknowledged that there have been no reports of ergogenic effects [58].

15. Magnesium

Magnesium (Mg) is an essential mineral that is recognized for its critical role in
athletic performance and overall health [294]. Magnesium helps to improve energy levels,
reduce fatigue, and even increase muscle performance, making it a vital nutrient for
athletes [36]. With its numerous beneﬁts, magnesium is being increasingly taken by athletes
to help them reach peak performance and maintain their physical health [294]. Magnesium
helps to improve energy levels by raising the ATP availability, which is best deﬁned as
the gold energy stores of cells [283]. Deﬁciency may cause ATP levels to be depleted,
resulting in fatigue and overall reduced performance [34]. The regular consumption of

Sports 2023, 11, 109

25 of 42

Mg can improve ATP production, providing athletes with increased energy and improved
endurance [295]. The mineral is also important for maintaining muscle performance and
reducing fatigue [296]. It is known to support muscle contraction and relaxation, allowing
for better muscle control and improved performance [142]. It also works to reduce lactic
acid buildup in muscles, which may help reduce pain during exercise and improve recovery
time [297].

Moreover, Mg has numerous other beneﬁts that support physical wellbeing. It helps
to improve sleep quality, regulate blood sugar, reduce stress, and even support the cardio-
vascular system [294,297]. By regularly taking Mg, athletes may beneﬁt from improved
energy production, reduced fatigue, and improved physical health, allowing them to reach
their maximum performance potential [36]. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
is 400 to 420 and 310 to 320 mg/day for 14 to over 70 years of age among males and females,
respectively [294].

Magnesium is a versatile mineral that is important for recovery and is found in over
300 enzymes that are involved in energy metabolism [297]. It is linked to strength training
and cardiorespiratory processes, showing a reciprocal relationship between exercise and
Mg in the human body [142]. Exercise controls Mg distribution and usage [296]. Training
triggers Mg to be transferred to areas where energy is produced [37]. For instance, during
prolonged activity, serum Mg may be transferred from serum blood to red blood cells
(RBCs) or muscle to support exercise. On the other hand, short-term exercise may result in
a reduction in the plasma/serum volume and a rise in serum Mg levels [297].

Magnesium contributes to the metabolism of energy and supports typical muscular
contraction and relaxation [283]. In male athletes, serum Mg levels are favorably correlated
with muscular performance [36]. Additionally, research suggests a possible connection
between Mg deﬁcit and muscle cramps by demonstrating how it might alter neuromuscular
function [297]. Physically active people might need more magnesium to sustain their peak
exercise performance than inactive people do [283]. Low Mg levels may cause ineffective
energy metabolism and decreased endurance in individuals who are engaged in a weight
training program [294]. Higher Mg consumption is linked to enhanced cardiorespiratory
function and lower oxygen demand during aerobic exercise [34]. Most studies reported
little impact of 500 mg/day Mg on exercise performance in athletes, unless there is a
deﬁcit [37,142,296]. A study of 16 physically active men who were assigned to 300 mg/day
for 14 days of Mg supplementation or a control group concluded no direct impact on
exercise performance while using Mg supplementation [296].

16. Zinc

Athletes of all ages and skill levels rely on zinc (Zn) to keep their bodies performing
at their peak [298]. It is an essential mineral that our bodies need for metabolic functions
such as cell repair, immune system functioning, hormone production, and healthy skin [38].
Unfortunately, not all athletes receive enough zinc from food intake, which may leave
athletes at a disadvantage [38]. According to the UK National Diet and Nutrition Survey
(NDNS), current daily intakes are 9.5 mg and 7.6 mg for men and women, respectively [299].
The survey has also shown that 6% of men and 7% of women do not receive enough zinc in
their diet, putting them at a greater risk of deﬁciency [300]. Fortunately, there are many
beneﬁts athletes may reap from adding zinc supplements to their routines [300].

One notable beneﬁt of zinc supplementation is the improvement in athletic perfor-
mance [281], as it reduces blood viscosity and enhances oxygen delivery, thereby boosting
aerobic endurance [38,281]. Zinc helps to increase strength and endurance, so athletes
may push their bodies to the limit while still receiving the nutrients they need [298]. A
double-blinded cross-over study featuring 16 female athletes was conducted to estimate
muscle strength and endurance [38]. The participants consumed 135 mg/day of Zn for 14
days and showed remarkably higher dynamic isokinetic strength and angular speed [29].
Additionally, Zn may help to reduce inﬂammation and soreness, which can accelerate
recovery time and reduce the risk of injury [59]. Zinc may also help in improving attention

Sports 2023, 11, 109

26 of 42

and focus [60]. This can assist athletes in staying focused on their tasks and performing at
their best. Zinc is a vital mineral for athletes of all ages and abilities [273]. Including it as a
supplement to their regimen may help enhance strength, endurance, and focus while also
reducing inﬂammation and supporting the immune system [92].

In addition, Zn may help to boost the immune system, making it easier for athletes
to ﬁght off colds and other illnesses that can stall their progress by increasing neutrophils’
ability to produce ROS after exercise [7]. It has been indicated that Zn oral consumption of
25 mg/day while exercising can reduce exercise-induced changes in immune function to
the minimum [298]. Moreover, Zn may help support healthy vision and keep skin healthy,
both of which are important for optimal performance [258]. Zn impacts the formation
and efﬁcient functioning of the skin and mucous membranes [298]. It helps maintain skin
cell membranes, and it plays a part in cell mitosis and differentiation; moreover, it has
an essential role in the survival of keratinocytes [215] and even in protecting skin against
induced UV radiation damage [301]. Lastly, taking Zn supplements may help athletes
meet their nutritional goals without having to increase their caloric intake, making it an
ideal supplement for those who are trying to stay lean [6]. Despite Zn supplements being
popular among athletes, there is limited proof regarding athletic performance improvement
in a period of 1–6 weeks, as shown in the study of Polat, 2011 [302].

To detect the actual impact of zinc oral consumption on the hematological parameters,
a study included 24 male kickboxing athletes, who were separated to form the three
following groups: the EZ group, meaning they were exercising and consuming 2.5 mg/kg
Zn supplement daily; the SZ group, who were supplemented without exercising; and the E
group, who were exercising without being supplemented. After the period of 8 weeks, the
results showed a signiﬁcant increase in the erythrocyte count of the EZ group compared
to the two other groups (p < 0.001). The hemoglobin and hematocrit levels increased in
the EZ group (p < 0.05). These results revealed that the combination of exercise and Zn
supplementation has a beneﬁcial impact on the hematological parameters of athletes, which
may result in enhanced performance and increased stamina [303]. Low levels of Zn in
the muscles may diminish exercise endurance because it is necessary for the activity of
energy metabolism enzymes [304]. Due to the inﬂuence of this enzyme on skeletal muscular
exercise, lactic dehydrogenase (a Zn-containing enzyme) may facilitate the conversion of
lactic acid to pyruvate [38]. This ﬁnding contradicts the commonly misinterpreted results of
previous studies [59,303], which demonstrated that lactate accumulation does not directly
cause fatigue [305].

17. Selenium

One possible approach for athletes to achieve their goals is by including selenium
(Se) in their diet, as this mineral can be found in a variety of foods [40]. Selenium,
when consumed in proper amounts, will help to boost an athlete’s performance, im-
prove mental focus, and reduce inﬂammation, thereby contributing to overall health and
ﬁtness [40,41,257].

Selenium can be found in certain plant and animal products, and it may also be
artiﬁcially added to processed foods [42]. It is advantageous for athletes due to its power-
ful antioxidant characteristics that boost the body’s defenses against cell damage, hence
increasing endurance, strength, and overall performance [40]. Additionally, Se may in-
crease mental focus, which improves an athlete’s ability to concentrate on tasks and stay
motivated, even if the competition gets tougher [41]. It can also help to reduce levels
of inﬂammation and support anti-inﬂammatory mechanisms, which may boost recovery
times and minimize the risk of injuries [95]. Low levels of serum Se are associated with
high serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), the inﬂammation biomarker [306] It is well
addressed that Se increases glutathione peroxidase production, which prevents the effect
of oxidative stress in response to exercise [303]. On the other hand, Se deﬁciency reduces
glutathione peroxidase activity indirectly through controlling the Nuclear Factor kappa-
light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) [257,307]. In the CHIANTI cohort study

Sports 2023, 11, 109

27 of 42

that assessed coordination performances among 1012 candidates aged 65 years or older, the
authors found a reduction in neurological performance that was signiﬁcantly associated
with the low levels of Se [308].

Incorporating Se into an athlete’s diet may be as simple as consuming more foods
that are naturally rich in Se or taking it in supplemental form. When consuming
the recommended amounts, it may increase the overall health and performance of
athletes [306,307,309]. Induced excessive mitochondrial oxidative stress could be caused
by Se supplements overdose and may lead to serious health problems [273] marked by
organelle damage and dysfunction [310]. Hence, it is important to integrate it into a bal-
anced diet in appropriate doses rather than consuming mega doses [311]. A systematic
review of oral Se supplementation of 180 µg/day or 240 µg/day (selenium methionine) and
200 µg/day (Sodium Selenite) reported a signiﬁcant drop in lipid hydroperoxide levels and
an increase in glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in plasma, erythrocyte, and muscle [306]. The
authors concluded that the consumption of Se supplements has no impact on aerobic or
anaerobic performance [306]. In addition, the study revealed that Se supplementation may
inhibit Se deﬁciencies induced by high-volume and -intensity exercise, but it has no impact
on anaerobic and aerobic athletic performance as well as creatine kinase activity, exercise
training-induced adaptations, and testosterone hormone levels [303,306].

18. Manganese

As athletes struggle to achieve their best performance, they often look to improve their
health and performance. One mineral that has been gaining recognition for its potential
beneﬁts is manganese (Mn) [312]. Mn is essential for several bodily functions, including
energy production, bone formation, and enzyme activity [264]. Early studies have shown
that it may help improve various aspects of athlete health and performance, but little is
known about the exact beneﬁts of Mn for athletes [205,303].

Manganese plays an important role in energy production, as it is involved in the
breaking-down of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats needed for energy production [205].
It also helps the body to utilize energy more efﬁciently, which may result in improved
endurance during long-term workouts and competitions [304]. Additionally, it aids in
the production of important neurotransmitters, which may improve mental focus and
coordination during physical activities [304]. Due to its crucial role in bone formation,
several studies reported the relationship between Mn and bone health [43] It helps in the
development of strong and healthy bones [43], which is crucial for athletes to prevent injury
and speed up recovery time. Low serum Mn levels have been reported among osteoporotic
women compared to healthy subjects [312]. Studies have also suggested that Mn helps to
protect cells from damage caused by ROS, which is important during periods of strenuous
exercise [95,304]. It is crucial for scavenging ROS in mitochondrial oxidative stress, as it
involves the Mn superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) component [95].

In a clinical trial, it was found that athletes had signiﬁcantly higher concentrations of
basal Mn levels vs. sedentary individuals, as observed through blood and urine measure-
ments [7]. Conversely, sedentary participants exhibited higher urine levels of Mn, which
could be attributed to the possibility of iron deﬁciency in athletes, leading to increased Mn
absorption [313]. There is limited evidence regarding Mn and athletic performance; how-
ever, athletes should be evaluated periodically for micronutrients deﬁciencies. Although
more research needs to be conducted, the current evidence suggested that Mn may be
beneﬁcial for athletes who are looking to optimize their performance and health [205,304].
Adding Mn to an athlete’s diet could be useful for maximizing their performance [95].

19. Micronutrients Deﬁciency and Energy Deﬁciency’s Impact on an
Athlete’s Performance

Pathways for utilizing energy are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by vitamins and miner-
als [93]. A variety of physiological systems depend on micronutrients, which also have
an impact on general health and athletic performance [23]. According to the widespread

Sports 2023, 11, 109

28 of 42

opinion on dietary guidelines for sports, a healthy athlete does not need to exceed RDA
values if they consume an adequate number of nutrient-dense foods [267]. Unfortunately,
many athletes do not meet the RDA requirements for most micronutrients [6,267]. Micronu-
trients would logically be impacted by poor macronutrient consumption [25]. It is common
among many athletes who are not aware about their exercise energy demands and, on the
contrary, suffer from being on a negative energy balance [2]. Negative energy balance due
to increased or decreased calorie intake or a combination of both is a powerful disruptor of
the endocrine milieu [123]. Additionally, it was associated with increased fatigue and men-
tal disorders [14], reduced fertility, poor bone quality, a higher likelihood of sports injuries,
endothelial dysfunction, a poor lipid proﬁle, gastrointestinal disturbances, inﬂammatory
processes, psychiatric conditions (such as emotional state changes/irritability), and poor
athletic performance [93,108,154,314].

One common energy deﬁciency condition among athletes is the female athlete triad,
characterized by disordered eating, negative energy balance, and irregular or absent men-
strual cycles [315]. This condition predisposes women to menstrual dysfunction (amen-
orrhea) [316], diminished bone mineral density, and premature osteoporosis [45]. Each
defect of the triad represents a signiﬁcant medical concern, and if occurring together, the
possibility of health concerns becomes even more serious and can often cause potential
threats to life [317]. Medical adverse consequences associated with disordered eating in-
volve decreased levels of glycogen in its stores, reduced lean body mass, long-term fatigue,
dehydration, micronutrient deﬁciencies, electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, anemia, gas-
trointestinal diseases, parotid gland enlargement, reduced bone density, and tooth enamel
erosion [300]. Osteoporosis can make adolescent female athletes prone to early bone loss
and the improper formation of bone, resulting in low bone mineral density [318] and an
elevated risk of stress fractures [319]. Bone mineral density lost because of amenorrhea may
be totally or, at least partially, irreversible, even with the resumption of menses, calcium
supplementation, and estrogen replacement therapy [256,320]. The dispensable role of
supplementary vitamins and minerals is a concern of the Dietitians of Canada and the
American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) for ensuring adequate energy requirements
are met from a varied and balanced diet with supplementations enrichment. Equally
importantly, sports medicine experts may recommend the use of vitamin and mineral
supplements in speciﬁc conditions such as energy intake restriction, the adoption of a
plant-based diet, the presence of illness, or recovery from injuries [242,263,301,321,322]. It
is worth noting that individual needs vary, and a personalized approach is crucial when
making supplement recommendations.

20. Conclusions

Vitamins and minerals are crucial for an athlete’s health and performance, none more
so than others. Micronutrients are essential to achieving optimal health and performance.
They participate in many metabolic processes in the body, including energy production,
muscle growth, and recovery. Athletes need to ensure they consume sufﬁcient quantities of
micronutrients to improve their physical activity and performance. A balanced diet that
includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins may help them
meet their micronutrient needs. Additionally, they may beneﬁt from taking a multivitamin
supplement if they are not meeting their micronutrient requirements or suffer from malab-
sorption or speciﬁc deﬁciencies in certain vitamins. However, athletes must avoid taking
micronutrient supplements without ﬁrst ensuring there is a deﬁciency. It is important to
consult with a physician or a dietitian to determine if supplementation is necessary and to
obtain a proper prescription.

Abstract
Vitamins and minerals are of fundamental importance to numerous human functions that are essential to optimise athlete 
performance. Athletes incur a high turnover of key vitamins and minerals and are therefore dependent on sufficient energy 
intake to replenish nutrient stores. However, many athletes are poor at servicing their energy replenishment needs, especially 
female athletes, and although a ‘food first approach’ to meeting nutrient requirements is the primary goal, it may be important 
for some athletes to consider a vitamin and/or mineral supplement to meet their daily needs. When working to determine if 
an athlete requires vitamin or mineral supplements, practitioners should use a robust framework to assess the overall energy 
requirements, current dietary practices and the biological and clinical status of their athletes. Of note, any supplementation 
plan should account for the various factors that may impact the efficacy of the approach (e.g. athlete sex, the nutrient recom-
mended dietary intake, supplement dose/timing, co-consumption of other foods and any food–drug interactions). Importantly, 
there are numerous vitamins and minerals of key importance to athletes, each having specific relevance to certain situations 
(e.g. iron and B vitamins are significant contributors to haematological adaptation, calcium and vitamin D are important to 
bone health and folate is important in the female athlete); therefore, the appropriate supplement for a given situation should 
be carefully considered and consumed with the goal to augment an athlete’s diet.

Key Points 

Athletes are generally poor at servicing their energy 
intake requirements, and although a ‘food first approach’ 
is a primary goal, certain situations (i.e. food-restricted 
diets, poor recovery timing and nutrition, etc.) may war-
rant an athlete to consider a vitamin or mineral supple-
ment to meet their daily needs.

There are numerous vitamins and minerals of key 
importance to athletes, each having specific relevance to 
certain situations. The usefulness of supplementation for 
a given situation should be carefully considered before 
use and consumed to augment an athlete’s typical diet.

Female athletes have nuanced vitamin and mineral 
requirements that differ to their male counterparts, and 
the research landscape requires significant work to better 
understand the unique nutritional challenges they face.

1  Introduction

Vitamins and minerals play a fundamental role in a pleth-
ora of human processes that are of significance to athlete 
health and performance. Movement-dependent functions, 
such as energy metabolism, oxygen transport, red blood 
cell production, immune function, muscle growth/repair, 
and bone health, are all dependent on vitamins and miner-
als in some way. However, in most instances, the body is 
unable to endogenously synthesise these essential nutri-
ents, and therefore, humans are dependent on exogenous 
food sources to supply our body’s vitamin and mineral 
needs. Of note, athletes present with an increased over-
all demand for vitamins and minerals, which is generally 
well-achieved when energy demands are met with appro-
priate levels of energy intake using a ‘food first approach’; 
defined as, ‘where practically possible, nutrient provision 
should  come  from  whole  foods  and  drinks  rather  than 
from isolated food components or dietary supplements’ 
[1]. However, certain situations (i.e. compromised energy 
intake, poor diet quality, low nutrient absorption) may 
warrant an athlete to consider a vitamin or mineral supple-
ment to meet their daily needs, and although this is appro-
priate, given the potential harm of over-supplementing or 
consuming supplements of banned nature, the choice of 
approach taken in such instances should be determined 
in consultation with a nutrition expert. Accordingly, it 
is important to remember the thoughts of Larson-Meyer 
et al., [2], that ‘Supplement intake cannot reverse poor 
food choices and an inadequate diet’; notwithstanding, the 
words of Close et al., to adopt a ‘food first but not always 
food only’ approach [1] are also pertinent when it comes 
to replacing vitamins and minerals in athletes with com-
promised nutrient intake.

2   Are Athletes at a Greater Risk 

of Deficiency?

There are a multitude of interacting factors that can con-
tribute to sub-optimal nutrient status in athletes; these 
factors include processes such as increased excretion in 
sweat,  urine  and  faeces,  increased  turnover,  decreased 
absorption  in  the  gastrointestinal  tract,  and  biochemi-
cal adaptation to training [3, 4]. Given the high training 
demands and overall daily energy expenditure of elite ath-
letes, greater exposure to the potential for exercise-induced 
vitamin and/or mineral deficiencies appears logical. How-
ever, broad vitamin and mineral deficiencies are uncom-
mon in athletes [5], since overall energy intake generally 
increases to meet the energy requirement of the training 

P. Peeling et al.

demand, which affords appropriate replenishment of the 
greater micronutrient needs. Regardless, it is not always 
the case that energy intake increases commensurate with 
training load. For example, it is not uncommon for energy 
availability to be compromised in endurance athletes with 
heavy daily training schedules, where repeated bouts of 
exercise  throughout  the  day  can  negatively  impact  the 
opportunity to adequately replenish energy requirements 
between sessions [6]. Further, the consumption of high-
energy processed foods (i.e. sport gels, bars, and other 
highly processed products) in such athletes can lead to 
poor nutrient composition and quality within the diet, even 
if energy intake is appropriate. Finally, in weight sensitive 
or aesthetic sports, low energy availability is commonly 
reported due to restricted dietary intake in an attempt to 
manipulate body composition [7]. Such compromised or 
restricted nutrient intake not only impacts an athlete’s 
energy status, but also their opportunity to replace any 
vitamins and minerals utilised or excreted during exer-
cise (i.e. B vitamins in energy production or electrolytes 
and iron in sweat) or those used in the recovery from/
adaptation to the training stimulus (i.e. iron in red blood 
cell production) [8]. Notwithstanding, it is also likely that 
the inflammatory responses to heavy training may impact 
the ability of an athlete to absorb various nutrients at the 
level of the gut [9], which over time can also contribute 
to a greater exposure to risk of nutrient deficiency. For 
instance, exercise-induced increases in the inflammatory 
cytokine interleukin-6 have been linked to increases in the 
liver-produced peptide, hepcidin, which when elevated, 
functions to decrease iron absorption in the gut [10], a 
process recognised to be a contributor to the commonly 
seen compromised iron stores of athlete populations [11]. 
To this end, it is clear that athletes present with a greater 
overall need for the considered intake of vitamins and min-
erals, with an increased risk of deficiency likely relevant 
to individuals where energy intake and replenishment are 
poor and/or training load is high.

3   What are the Assessment Frameworks 

to Explore a Deficiency?

Underlying nutrient deficiencies in athlete populations may 
impact a variety of health and performance outcomes. Com-
monly, symptoms of nutrient depletion in athlete populations 
tend to initially present as feelings of lethargy and fatigue 
[12], which may eventually impact training consistency, 
and therefore performance, over time. Given these potential 
negative implications for performance, it is integral that the 
nutrition support team working with athletes have a well-
structured process of assessment to uncover nutrient issues 
prior to it affecting performance; this approach can also 

provide a comprehensive assessment tool to evaluate the 
need for dietary supplements when addressing any identified 
problems. In an attempt to provide this structure, a modi-
fied A–E framework of adapted nutritional assessment has 
been previously proposed [2, 13]. This framework provides 
a comprehensive assessment of nutritional status across five 
key domains, including:

•  Anthropometrics, to assess an athlete’s body composition 

and any changes over time,

•  Biochemical analysis, to assess the presence and levels 
of targeted biomarkers (e.g. iron, vitamin D [25(OH)D], 
etc.) in the blood, saliva and/or urine against commonly 
accepted thresholds,

•  Clinical assessment, to provide insight into the presence 
of any relevant history and/or symptoms impacting the 
athlete,

•  Dietary analysis of nutrient intake over time via various 

methods of food intake recall,

•  Environment scan, entailing an assessment of the ath-
lete’s surroundings to explore the impact of factors such 
as living setting, social and cultural factors, training pro-
gramming, etc. on nutrient intake as an underlying cause 
of any potential issues.

It should be noted that individual aspects of this compre-
hensive assessment approach may be conducted by numer-
ous individuals within the sports medicine team supporting 
an athlete (i.e. dietitian, sports physician, etc.), highlighting 
the multidisciplinary approach to athlete service provision. 
In combination, the interrogation of these five factors pro-
vides a comprehensive assessment tool to enable the detec-
tion of nutrient disorders, the potential contributing factors 
to the disorder, and the approach (i.e. nutritional correction 
or supplementation) to address any identified problem(s).

4   What are the Strategies to Prevent 
and Treat Nutrient Deficiency?

If a nutrient deficiency is uncovered, consideration needs 
to  be  given  to  numerous  underlying  factors  that  could 
influence the success of any intervention. One significant 
factor  might  include  the  approach  taken  to  correcting 
the issues. For instance, for any given identified nutrient 
deficiency, there are several approaches that can be taken 
to improve the situation. An initial approach might be a 
‘food first’ prospect, whereby there is a concerted push to 
increase the availability of the lacking nutrient in the ath-
lete’s overall daily energy intake [1, 2]. Although this food 
first approach is a preferred starting point for any nutri-
tional intervention, the efficacy of this approach is only at 
its highest when there is an obvious and addressable issue 

S17

with diet composition and/or energy intake. However, it 
is not always possible to correct a nutrient deficiency by 
simply advising the athlete to eat more, especially when a 
deficiency generally requires more of the specific nutrient 
to fix the problem than the typical Recommended Dietary 
Intake (RDI) [1]. Of note, RDI is the average amounts of 
specific nutrients required daily for sustenance or avoid-
ance of deficiency states [14].

Given this issue, a concurrent approach to increasing 
nutrient density from food might be to explore the addition 
of a specific oral supplement (i.e. relevant to the observed 
nutrient deficiency) into the athlete’s daily nutrition routine 
(e.g. consuming a daily iron supplement to make up for low 
overall iron intake in a vegetarian diet). In general, the effi-
cacy of this approach is usually high; however, the process 
to replete an issue is usually slow (i.e. at least 4–12 weeks in 
the case of vitamin D [15, 16] and iron [17, 18]), could result 
in some level of gastrointestinal (GI) distress, and as with 
any commercially available supplement, may be accompa-
nied by some level of risk relevant to supplement contami-
nation [19]. Therefore, a well-considered approach using 
batch-tested supplements should be undertaken.

Given the length of time required to correct a deficiency 
through  food  first  and/or  oral  supplementation,  a  final 
approach available for some deficiencies (e.g. iron and B 
vitamins)  might  be  to  consider  infusion  of  the  depleted 
nutrient directly into the circulation (i.e. parenteral supple-
mentation). Given that most nutrient deficiencies have their 
origin at the level of the gut, parenteral approaches to sup-
plementation are attractive since they bypass this issue, and 
their effect is immediate. However, parenteral approaches to 
nutrient supplementation are associated with their own set 
of risks [20], such as adverse reactions to the infusion itself, 
issues and (well-justified) stigma with needle policies in elite 
sporting organisations [21] and antidoping rule considera-
tions for routes of administration that must be considered. 
Accordingly, it is not uncommon that this final approach 
to nutrient supplementation is generally reserved for more 
severe  and  persistent  cases  of  deficiency,  and  therefore 
should only be considered in collaboration with a trained 
sports physician.

Once the approach of supplementation is determined, 
other considerations for the practitioner working with ath-
letes  who  present  with  an  identified  nutrient  deficiency 
might include:

•  The dose (which will likely be greater than the RDI to 
correct an issue) and formulation of the supplement,
•  The timing of supplement consumption (i.e. time of day 

and proximity to exercise or feeding),

•  The interactions of the supplement with other food (e.g. 
co-consumption of iron and calcium can decrease the

absorption of iron, whereas co-consumption of iron and 
vitamin C can enhance the effect [22]),

as key (and common) contributors to an athlete’s potential 
for adaptation, and their overall health.

•  Any food–drug interactions that might be of relevance 
(e.g.  oral  contraceptives  negatively  impacting  folate 
metabolism, etc. [2]),

•  The duration of supplement consumption (i.e., how many 
weeks will be required to see a positive impact and return 
to healthy levels),

•  The frequency of biochemical monitoring to assess effi-

cacy of effect.

Clearly, there are a myriad of factors to consider when 
determining the best approach to addressing an athlete’s 
nutrient deficiency, with specific nuances relevant to the 
lacking nutrient likely needing attention when devising the 
best way to rectify the issue.

5   Important Vitamins and Minerals 

for Athletes

When considering the numerous vitamins and minerals 
that exist in our diet, and the innumerable functions they 
play, it becomes clear that a comprehensive review of them 
all would be impractical (although readers are referred 
to Beck et al. [23] for further detailed review). However, 
from an athlete-centric perspective, there are some key 
vitamins and minerals that are integral to adaptation and 
optimal  function.  Accordingly,  we  have  delimited  our 
attention here to several key nutrients (Table 1) of impor-
tance to haematology, bone health and immune function, 

5.1   Haematology

From a haematological perspective, iron, folic acid and vita-
min B12 are significant contributors to red cell production 
[24]. The importance of iron is well established for its criti-
cal role in the formation of haemoglobin incorporated within 
red blood cells and enzymes integral to the electron transport 
chain at a cellular level. Consequently, iron is integral to key 
processes including oxygen transport and energy production, 
which are highly relevant to athletes [25]. However, iron 
deficiency is reported to affect ~ 10% of male and ~ 35% of 
female athletes [26] and is among the most common nutri-
ent disorders reported in athlete populations. Currently, it 
is established that there are three stages of iron deficiency, 
which progressively increase in symptoms and severity of 
effect as the depletion of serum ferritin (sFer), haemoglobin 
(Hb) and transferrin saturation (TSAT) progress [27]. Stage 
1 is iron depletion (ID), characterised by a reduction in sFer 
without impact on red blood cell production. Stage 2 is iron 
deficiency non-anaemia (IDNA) which presents with further 
depleted sFer, causing erythropoiesis to diminish as the iron 
supply to the erythroid marrow is reduced (as evident by a 
decrease in TSAT). Stage 3 is iron-deficient anaemia (IDA) 
which represents the most serious and debilitating level of 
compromise, where low sFer and TSAT have progressed to 
a decrement in Hb concentration. Here, not only do athletes 
report the common feelings of lethargy and fatigue (as they 
do in stage 1, iron depletion), but they also present with 
reductions in overall physical capacity [11]. Previous work 
has developed athlete-specific blood screening [11] and iron

supplementation frameworks [22], thus providing practition-
ers with guidelines and strategies to mitigate the progression 
of stage 1 iron depletion to a more severe stage of impact 
(i.e. stages 2 and 3). Interestingly, current data suggest that 
iron supplementation in the absence of severe deficiency 
(i.e. IDA) is unlikely to result in performance benefits for 
athletes, with meta-analyses demonstrating unchanged per-
formance outcomes in iron-deficient non-anaemic (IDNA) 
athletes [28]. However, iron supplementation provided to 
IDNA individuals has been shown to improve haemoglobin 
and ferritin concentrations, whilst also reducing the sub-
jective feelings of fatigue during exercise [29], which can 
impact the quality and consistency of training over time. 
Furthermore, under exceptional circumstances of environ-
mental stress, such as altitude training designed to stimulate 
red cell production, iron supplements should be considered 
in athletes with suboptimal ferritin stores, in an effort to 
meet the additional erythropoietic demands of the hypoxic 
stimulus [11, 30].

In addition to iron, it is also well recognised that B vita-
mins have an important role in haematological function in 
active populations [31]. Of the nine B vitamins found within 
the diet, folate (B9) and cobalamin (B12) play crucial roles 
in facilitating the production of red cells in the bone marrow 
[32]. Interestingly, clinical B12 [33] or folate deficiency [34] 
can result in megaloblastic anaemia, due to disruption of 
DNA synthesis and repair that results in ineffective erythro-
poiesis [24]. Notably, pernicious anaemia, a form of megalo-
blastic anaemia, occurs due to B12 deficiency and can only 
be treated with parenteral administration of B12 due to a 
lack of gastric intrinsic factors required for B12 absorption 
[35]. In athlete populations, observational data suggest that 
low circulating levels of B12 are mildly associated with 
lower haemoglobin concentration and haematocrit, and that 
B12 supplements may be beneficial to haematological adap-
tation when suboptimal levels are detected in the blood [36]. 
However, standardised thresholds for the classification of 
B12 deficiency in athletes are not well defined, and there-
fore, further work is required to establish best practice guide-
lines for addressing this issue. Of note, the impact of low 
B12 levels is especially pertinent to vegetarian and vegan 
athletes, since B12 is found more readily in animal food 
sources. Accordingly, athletes adhering to certain dietary 
restrictions may need to be mindful of relevant sources of 
B12 in their diet, and not averse to biochemical and clinical 
assessment of B12 and iron stores if persistent feelings of 
lethargy are present.

5.2   Bone Metabolism

When considering bone health, vitamin D [37] and cal-
cium [38] have been extensively studied in athlete popu-
lations. Vitamin D is known to play an important role in 

S19

calcium homeostasis, which is essential for bone health, 
thus having a positive effect on mitigating fracture risk. 
Vitamin D can have a positive effect on osteoblasts and 
bone remodelling via induction of receptor activator of 
nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANK-L) and phosphate homeo-
stasis [39]. Collectively, such factors, in combination with 
the mechanical loads of exercise, are hypothesised to stim-
ulate mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling, which 
may promote increased bone mineral density and lower 
fracture risk (see [37] for review).

Current literature indicates that any benefits of vitamin 
D supplements on athlete health likely depend on circulat-
ing levels of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25[OH]D), with 
between 30% and 39% of elite athletes being reported to 
present with insufficiency (< 50 nmol/L) [40]. Importantly, 
there appears to be no ergogenic benefit of providing doses 
of supplemental vitamin D to elevate 25[OH]D beyond 
sufficiency (> 75 nmol/L), with excessive supplementa-
tion using mega dosages resulting in excessive vitamin D 
levels (e.g. 25[OH]D > 180 nmol/L), which may ultimately 
be detrimental to one’s health [37]. Such events are often 
accompanied by severe hypercalcemia and hypercalciu-
ria, as well as low parathyroid hormone activity, which 
may compromise bone integrity [41]. Interestingly, meta-
analyses of male and female athletes and military person-
nel (participating in a variety of activities such as soccer, 
baseball, dancing, swimming, American Football and mili-
tary recruit training) report that low 25[OH]D (< 30 ng/
mL) is associated with greater risk for stress fractures 
(n = 7 studies, 3625 participants) [42], highlighting the 
importance of maintaining adequate 25[OH]D levels and 
regular screening regimes.

In addition to vitamin D, low serum calcium caused by 
dietary insufficiencies is known to stimulate an increase in 
parathyroid hormone (PTH) and osteoclast activity, inducing 
a catabolic effect on bone [43]. Importantly, habitual low 
dietary calcium intake is associated with poor bone mineral 
density [44], with purported causes suggested to include 
insufficient/restrictive energy intake, the avoidance of cer-
tain foods (i.e. dairy products) and/or lactose intolerance 
[8]. Such scenarios may benefit from calcium supplements 
to support bone health. Finally, a reduction in serum ionised 
calcium occurs during exercise, prompting an increase in 
PTH activity and bone resorption [45]. Interestingly, pre-
exercise calcium intake (1000 mg) has been shown to mini-
mise perturbations of bone calcium homeostasis [46], and 
therefore, this approach might be considered for athletes at 
heightened risk of bone injury. In athlete populations, a cal-
cium RDI of 1500 mg/day has been suggested appropriate to 
meet increased metabolic demands and support bone health 
[47]. To maximise absorption, this calcium intake should be 
apportioned in smaller doses (i.e. 500 mg portions) through-
out the day [48], which can be found in food sources such as 

Vitamins and Minerals for AthletesS20 

P. Peeling et al.

dairy products (e.g. milk, yoghurts, cheese) or plant-based 
foods (e.g.,green leafy vegetables, broccoli, soybeans, forti-
fied plant-based milks).

5.3   Immune Function

Sub-optimal nutrition is a major risk factor for illness and 
infection in athletes [49], with low energy availability often 
highlighted as a major consideration [7]. A range of nutrients 
are known to play a significant role in immune function (i.e. 
iron, vitamins A, D, E, B6, B12; for review see [50]). For 
instance, vitamin D is reported to play an important role in 
both innate and acquired immunity, with numerous reports 
presenting a case for an inverse relationship between vitamin 
D concentrations and upper respiratory infection (URI) in 
athletes and military personnel (for review see [37]).

In addition to vitamin D, zinc and vitamin C are com-
monly considered supplements to help improve immune 
function [51]. Zinc is reported to play an important role 
in nucleotide and nucleic acid synthesis, whilst also act-
ing as an antiviral agent by increasing interferon gamma, 
thus decreasing the docking of common cold viruses with 
binding sites [52]. When considering URI, the potential anti-
oxidant and anti-inflammatory influence of zinc may also 
contribute towards the tolerogenic effects on immunity, with 
recent meta-analyses reporting that the duration of URI was 
reduced by 33% (translating to ~ 3 days) if 75 mg/day of 
elemental zinc was provided within the first 24 h of illness 
symptoms developing [53]. Interestingly, a previous sys-
tematic review has reported that athletes often present with 
lower circulating zinc concentrations than the general popu-
lation, despite their greater dietary intake [54]. This suggests 
that the zinc requirements of athletes are likely higher than 
the general population, possibly due to sweat losses expe-
rienced as part of extended periods of intense training [55].
Often promoted for its antioxidant capacity [56], vita-
min C is an active scavenger of reactive oxygen species 
in  intra-  and  extra-cellular  fluid  [57].  During  infection, 
vitamin C levels in leucocytes can fall by up to 50% [58], 
which have been linked to increased oxidative stress. Such 
events provide rationale for vitamin C intake when attempt-
ing to preserve athlete health, especially during infection 
or during heavy training where inflammation and oxida-
tive stress are acutely increased. In fact, meta-analyses of 
18 randomised controlled trials in exercising populations 
(conducted from 1998 to 2019; n = 313 participants) showed 
vitamin C supplementation attenuated the oxidative stress 
and inflammatory response to a single bout of exercise [59]. 
Interestingly, clinical trials have reported a dose–response 
relationship between vitamin C supplementation and URI 
duration, with large daily oral dosages between 3 to 8 g [60, 
61]. Furthermore, a 2013 Cochrane review reported that in 
five studies conducted from 1961 to 1996, low-dose vitamin 

C supplements (0.25–1.0 g/day) provided to ‘heavy exer-
cisers’ (n = 589 marathoners, skiers and military personnel) 
reduced the incidence of URI by ~ 52% [62]. Such findings 
have led to the common suggestion that vitamin C supple-
ments might be considered for athletes during periods of 
heightened infection risk, such as extended periods of heavy 
training or travelling for key competitions [63].

6   Special Considerations for Female 

Athletes

Females have distinct biological and phenotypical attributes 
which make the nutrient needs of female athletes unique. In 
females, the sex hormones, oestrogen and progesterone, play 
an important role in reproductive development and men-
struation [64], signalling the release of other hormones (such 
as luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone), 
which also have important roles in ovulation and maintaining 
pregnancy. Female ovarian hormones not only change across 
the life span (from puberty through to menopause), but also 
change cyclically throughout the four phases of the men-
strual cycle (1—menstruation phase, 2—follicular phase, 
3—ovulation phase, 4—luteal phase). For instance, during 
menstruation, concentrations of both ovarian hormones are 
low [65]; however, oestrogen levels increase during the fol-
licular phase to stimulate ovulation, prior to high circulating 
concentrations of both oestrogen and progesterone during 
the luteal phase. Of note, concentrations of these hormones 
may also change due to other stimuli, such as pregnancy, 
hormonal contraception use or diet/exercise interactions 
[65]. In addition to their reproductive roles, ovarian ster-
oids can influence a variety of physiological and biological 
processes, such as thermoregulation, metabolism, cognition 
and autonomic regulation [65–67]. When considered col-
lectively, the implications of these physiological alterations 
may extend to impact athletic performance. Indeed, a recent 
meta-analysis concluded that exercise performance might 
be trivially reduced during the early follicular phase of the 
menstrual cycle [68]; however, there were numerous issues 
with the available data, such that the majority of studies 
were considered to be of ‘low’ quality, and there was large 
between-study variance identified, making it difficult to infer 
any practical conclusions for elite female athletes. Regard-
less, it is evident that female athletes more commonly pre-
sent with certain micronutrient deficiencies [69, 70], and 
therefore, nutritional approaches that consider the unique 
needs of female athletes are required.

Currently, there is limited research exploring the perio-
disation of nutrition around the menstrual cycle. However, 
there are minerals which merit closer investigation, such as 
the intake of iron. This is particularly important to menstru-
ating female athletes who might experience losses equating 

to between 5 and 40 mg of iron each cycle [71,  72]. Of 
note, this number is likely much higher in women with heavy 
menstrual bleeding (HMB), a condition thought to be highly 
prevalent in athletic cohorts [73]. Interestingly, hepcidin, 
the aforementioned iron regulatory hormone responsible for 
controlling iron absorption, has been shown to be downregu-
lated by oestrogen [74], which means that iron absorption 
might be increased when oestrogen levels are high (i.e. fol-
licular phase of the menstrual cycle). This may provide a 
window of opportunity for females to recover the net iron 
loss from menstruation. While mechanistic support for this 
association is strong, studies of human trials are unclear 
[75, 76] and no study has yet directly assessed changes in 
iron absorption (rather than hormonal alterations) across the 
menstrual cycle in female athletes.

Regardless, these menstrual blood losses and hormonal 
fluctuations are unique to female athletes, and result in a 
greater iron requirement compared with males. Indeed, this 
is reflected in the RDI guidelines for the general popula-
tion, where iron consumption recommendations in females 
are more than double that of males (18 versus 8 mg/day) 
[14]. However, this RDI can be quite difficult for females to 
achieve as their generally smaller body size means a lower 
absolute energy intake is required when compared with 
males. The typical western diet provides ~ 6 mg of iron in 
every 1000 kcal [77]; therefore, females are required to eat 
more nutrient dense foods to achieve their dietary iron target 
within their caloric requirements. To compound this issue, 
female athletes commonly follow diets that are restrictive, 
including vegetarian or vegan diets low in quality (haem) 
iron sources [11], or those limiting either carbohydrate or 
energy intake [78], which have been shown to contain lower 
amounts of dietary iron. Accordingly, inadequate energy 
intake, and therefore lower dietary iron intake, contributes 
to the higher incidence of iron deficiency seen in female ath-
letic populations [79]. Consequently, an increased focus on 
either dietary or supplemental iron intake in female athletes 
is required, particularly where additional challenges to iron 
balance occur from high exercise loads. This is reflected in 
the iron screening recommendations for athletes [11], which 
suggest that females should have their iron status assessed at 
6-month intervals, especially in cases of known iron com-
promise. The more frequent routine screening of women 
allows minor deficiencies in iron (i.e. stage 1 iron depletion) 
to be treated prior to progression towards severe stages of 
the nutrient disorder (i.e. stage 3 IDA).

In addition to iron, folate is a B vitamin of particular 
importance to pre-conception and throughout pregnancy. As 
described previously, both iron and folate have fundamen-
tal roles in erythropoiesis [80]. Further, folate coenzymes 
are essential in nucleic acid synthesis, methionine regen-
eration, and in one-carbon metabolism [81], making them 
particularly important during periods of rapid growth (i.e. 

S21

during pregnancy). Female athletes training throughout their 
pregnancy should strongly consider both iron and folate sup-
plementation, as the added haematological stress of high 
exercise volumes on top of those associated with foetal 
growth and development may accelerate the progression of 
a deficiency, if not treated proactively. Indeed, during preg-
nancy, the RDI for dietary iron increases from 18 to 27 mg/
day  [14]  to  accommodate  the ~ 2-fold  increase  in  blood 
volume [82]. Similarly, folate requirements are estimated 
to be ~ 2-fold higher [83], as reflected in the recommended 
daily allowances, which increase from 400 to 600 µg dietary 
folate equivalents (DFE). These recommendations are based 
on the general population, as athletic specific values do not 
currently exist; however, they should be generally applicable 
assuming a pre-existing deficiency is not evident. Neverthe-
less, given the lack of research in the area, individualised 
consultation and screening for nutrient deficiencies through-
out pregnancy is strongly advised. Interestingly, there is evi-
dence to suggest that oral contraceptive use is also associ-
ated with a reduction in plasma folate concentrations and 
red blood cell folate concentrations [84]. Accordingly, ath-
letes using oral contraceptives may need to consider higher 
folate consumption, particularly if planning pregnancy. Of 
note, many prenatal vitamins will contain between 800 and 
1000 µg DFE of folic acid, which will support reproductive 
health and provide protective effects on the foetus when used 
for 3–6 months prior to conception [85].

Clear  associations  between  menstrual  function,  bone 
health  and  energy  availability  have  previously  been 
described  via  the  Female  Athlete  Triad  [86]  and  more 
recently as part of the Relative Energy Deficiency in Sport 
(REDs) model [87]. Female athletes with amenorrhoea often 
present with poor bone mineral density, bone microarchi-
tecture and/or bone turnover markers, placing them at an 
increased risk of stress fractures [88, 89]. Considering that 
peak bone mass is often attained by 30 years of age, and 
that 95% of a young woman’s peak bone mass is present 
by age 20 [90], this would substantially increase the risk of 
developing early onset osteoporosis, which will present as 
a major complication in late-life. Interestingly, in a single 
study of male and female athletes, low energy availability 
[(LEA) 15 kcal·kg·FFM−1] resulted in negative alterations 
to bone turnover markers (BTMs) following exercise in only 
female participants [91].While acknowledging the limita-
tions associated with using BTMs to infer bone health, it 
may allude to an ability for men to better tolerate caloric 
restriction compared with women [92]. While vitamin and 
mineral intake can help support bone health, it is less effec-
tive when low energy availability is present, and in these 
instances optimising energy intake should be the primary 
nutritional intervention to improve poor bone health.

Overall,  when  considering  the  unique  challenges  of 
female athletes and the associated needs for vitamin and 

Vitamins and Minerals for AthletesS22

mineral intake, it should be mentioned that a recent audit 
on the representation of women in research examining iron, 
calcium  and  vitamin  D  supplementation  [93]  found  not 
one study was able to classify and report menstrual status 
according to best practice guidelines [65]. Furthermore, only 
13% of all study participants in this research could be clas-
sified as female athletes [93]. Therefore, without research 
effectively reporting and controlling for menstrual status, 
or even using female athletic populations, it is not currently 
possible to provide conclusive recommendations for vitamin 
and mineral intake specific to an athlete’s menstrual status 
or menstrual cycle. Accordingly, a greater effort to explore 
the unique nutrient needs of the female athlete is warranted.

7   Summary and Conclusions

Athletes are regularly exposed to high levels of training 
stress, and therefore, their energy intake needs to match 
the energy demand. However, there are a variety of factors 
that contribute to the poor replenishment of energy needs 
in athletes, and as such, the replenishment of key vitamins 
and minerals can be compromised, putting athletes at an 
increased risk of nutrient deficiencies. Given this increased 
risk, it is important that practitioners use a robust frame-
work to assess the overall energy requirements, the current 
dietary practices and the biological and clinical status of 
their athletes, to identify if and when an athlete may require 
nutritional intervention. Should a nutrient deficiency be 
detected, it is important to consider the appropriate approach 
to correcting the problem, whilst also accounting for the 
various factors (e.g. the nutrient RDI, supplement dose/
timing, co-consumption of other foods and any food–drug 
interactions) that may impact the efficacy of the approach. 
Of note, there are numerous vitamins and minerals of key 
importance to athletes, each having specific relevance to 
certain situations (e.g. iron and B vitamins are significant 
contributors to haematological adaptation). Accordingly, the 
usefulness of supplementation for a given situation should 
be carefully considered before use, and supplements should 
be consumed to augment an athlete’s typical diet, remember-
ing the adage that ‘supplement intake cannot reverse poor 
food choices and an inadequate diet’ [2]. Finally, it should 
be noted that the female athlete has nuanced vitamin and 
mineral requirements that differ to their male counterparts, 
and that the research landscape requires significant work to 
better understand the unique nutritional challenges they face.

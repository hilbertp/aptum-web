Abstract
This study introduces a new method of targeting acidosis (low pH) within the tumor microenvironment (TME) through the 
use of cathodic electrochemical reactions (CER). Low pH is oncogenic by supporting immunosuppression. Electrochemical 
reactions create local pH effects when a current passes through an electrolytic substrate such as biological tissue. Electrolysis 
has been used with electroporation (destabilization of the lipid bilayer via an applied electric potential) to increase cell death 
areas. However, the regulated increase of pH through only the cathode electrode has been ignored as a possible method to 
alleviate TME acidosis, which could provide substantial immunotherapeutic benefits. Here, we show through ex vivo mod-
eling that CERs can intentionally elevate pH to an anti-tumor level and that increased alkalinity promotes activation of naïve 
macrophages. This study shows the potential of CERs to improve acidity within the TME and that it has the potential to be 
paired with existing electric field-based cancer therapies or as a stand-alone therapy.

Introduction

Acidity  (low  pH)  is  an  oncogenic  characteristic  of  the 
tumor microenvironment, supporting immunosuppression 
and tumor expansion.13 Low pH arises from increased pro-

increasingly rely on aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect).18 
At a lower pH, T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cell 
function  decreases  and  cells  may  become  apoptotic.4,20 
Conversely, immunosuppressive cells (regulatory T cells) 
 activate42 and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) trans-
form into a pro-tumor phenotype.11 Therefore, tumor acidity 
is a critical regulator of cancer immunity that orchestrates 
both local and systemic immunosuppression,8 providing a 
need for therapeutic targets.

Previous studies have targeted tumor pH using oral buff-
ers (sodium bicarbonate) to elevate the TME pH and encour-
age immune cell infiltration.33 While effective in preventing 
metastases, sodium bicarbonate therapy does not address the 
primary tumor when used as a monotherapy.36 Recently, a 
combinatorial therapy of ethanol ablation (to treat the pri-
mary tumor) in conjunction with oral sodium bicarbonate (to 
elevate tumor pH) and cyclophosphamide (to deplete regula-
tory T cells) proved effective in treating the primary tumor 
and in preventing metastases.25

Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), one of the many neo-
plasms associated with chronic inflammation (and an onco-
genic TME),7 leads to sustained changes in both the innate

hepatic immune response and systemic immune cell infiltra-
tion.34 Surgical resection (transplant or partial hepatectomy) 
currently provides the best clinical strategy to treat HCC 
patients but can be limited by late diagnosis, tumor size and/
or location, underlying pathology, and lack of organs for 
transplant.2 Although thermal ablation (radiofrequency and 
microwave ablation (RFA/MWA)) has emerged as a viable 
alternative to resection for liver neoplasms,19 the indiscrimi-
nate tissue damage arising within the ablative zone can lead 
to challenges when ablating tumors located near critical 
structures.

Irreversible  electroporation  (IRE)  has  emerged  as  an 
alternative to thermal ablation.9 With IRE systems a high 
voltage electrical potential is delivered in short pulses (80-
100  μs)  across  the  target  region  between  appropriately 
placed electrodes leading to the formation of nanodefects 
in the lipid bilayer of cells within the electric field. These 
nanodefects can lead to loss of homeostasis and induce cell 
death pathways.1 Unlike thermal ablation, IRE selectively 
induces cell death within the ablation zone without dam-
age to the underlying tissue architecture, preventing damage 
to structures such as blood vessels, ducts, and nerves.22,32 
Notably, due to its non-thermal cell death mechanism, IRE 
treatment initiates a robust anti-tumor response by preserv-
ing antigen presentation.3,14,35

Electrochemical reactions that occur proximal to the elec-
trodes in IRE treatments alter the tissue’s pH immediately 
around the cathode (alkaline) and anode (acidic).41 Others 
have exploited electrolysis to generate toxic byproducts to 
increase ablation volumes by taking advantage of the revers-
ible electroporation regime.16,31 In such cases, the electro-
chemical reactions are maximized through monophasic, long 
(or DC), low voltage pulses, or high-charge exponentially 
decaying pulses.37 Importantly, electrolytic electroporation 
uses bipolar geometries in which both the cathode and anode 
contribute to the formation of electrolytic byproducts. We 
hypothesize that through proper pulse parameter selection 
and electrode geometry we could exploit these electrochemi-
cal reactions to elevate the pH and reduce the immunosup-
pressive nature of the TME.

Here, we propose a combinatorial therapy to target the 
primary tumor (IRE) and then elevate the local pH through 
electrochemical reactions to support the anti-tumor immune 
response. We first study the impact of DC pulse parameters 
and electrode geometries on tissue pH, then examine the 
impact of pH changes on THP-1 macrophage activation, 
before  demonstrating  in  a  proof-of-concept  experiment 
that the pulsing strategy developed herein can re-establish 
a homeostatic electrochemical TME. Agar tissue mimics 
visualized the electrochemical effects via a pH indicator 
dye, flow cytometry analysis of THP-1 cells revealed the 
effect of elevated pH on a representative immune cell (mac-
rophages), and ex vivo porcine liver provided a clinically 

49

relevant domain to test our combinatorial therapy because 
it is analogous to HCC, a plausible treatment target. Our 
results demonstrate that long, low voltage pulses applied 
through  the  cathode  terminal  successfully  increases  the 
pH of liver tissue to an anti-tumor level (as determined by 
in vitro studies), validating the potential use of electrolysis 
to treat acidosis within the TME and promote an anti-tumor 
immune response.

Materials and Methods

Area of pH Change

Agarose Tissue Phantom Preparation

A 1% (w/v) agar (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA) solution 
was prepared in deionized water (90 °C) and 10% (v/v) bro-
mothymol blue (pH indicator) added (ThermoFisher). To 
control electrical conductivity, NaCl was added in 0.1% 
(w/v)  increments  (final  NaCl  concentration;  0.1–1.0%) 
and phantoms were allowed to solidify overnight (room 
temperature).

Pulse Parameters for Increasing Voltage or Current Delivery

Pulse width (10 ms), pulse number (100), and frequency 
(1 Hz) were held constant while voltage or current was 
increased (i.e., current was maintained with increasing volt-
age or vice versa) in the NaCl containing phantoms. A single 
pre-pulse (10 V, 50 µs length) was delivered to each phantom 
to determine initial resistance and Ohm’s law used to deter-
mine the change in voltage (or current) required to deliver 
constant current (or maintain a predetermined voltage).

Increasing Pulse Width

Current (100 mA), voltage (100 V), and frequency (1 Hz) 
were held constant while pulse width was increased (100 µs 
− 1 s). In doing so, the generator was unable to store suf-
ficient charge to deliver a 1 s pulse at 100 V, so the voltage 
was dropped to 10 V for the 1 s pulse width and the fre-
quency decreased to 0.5 Hz (allowing a 1 s interval between 
pulses).

Pulse Delivery and pH Measurement

Treatments were applied to phantoms using an ECM 830 
Square Wave Electroporator (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, 
MA). Current and voltage readings were collected using a 
wideband current monitor (Pearson Electronics, Palo Alto, 
CA) connected to an oscilloscope (Wavesurfer 3024z, Tel-
edyne LeCroy, Chestnut Ridge, NY). Each treatment was

applied using a custom needle-grounding ring electrode con-
figuration. Representative images were captured and area of 
alkaline pH (pH > 7.6 = blue) was quantified using ImageJ 
software (NIH, Bethesda, MD).

Effect of Probe Number and Geometry

Number of electrodes (2-4) and arrangement was varied; 
When  two  electrodes  were  used  the  anode  and  cathode 
remained constant. When three electrodes were used, each 
of the three possible electrode pairs was used for one third 
of the treatment protocol. When four electrodes were used, 
each of the 6 possible electrode pairs was used for one sixth 
of the treatment. For groups in which a grounding ring was 
included, all the electrodes were connected to the cathode 
and  the  grounding  ring  connected  to  the  anode.  Energy 
matched IRE (1000 V at 100 μs) and longer, lower voltage 
pulse settings (10 V at 1 s) per pulse were compared.

Cell Culture

Purified THP-1 monocytes (TIB-202, ATCC, Manassas, 
VA) were cultured (2 ×  105–8 ×  105 cells/mL) in RPMI-
1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 1% (v/v) 
penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.05 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. 
Differentiation of THP-1 monocytes was induced by the 
addition of 150 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) 
(24 hours) followed by replacement with PMA-free culture 
medium for a further 24 hours. To induce M1 activation, 
differentiated THP-1 macrophages were cultured in the pres-
ence of IFN-γ (20 ng/mL) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 
1 ng/mL) for 48 hours. To induce M2 activation, differenti-
ated THP-1 macrophages were cultured in the presence of 
interleukin-4 (IL-4; 20 ng/mL) and interleukin-13 (IL-13; 
20 ng/mL) for 48 hours.

Effect of Altered pH on Macrophage Activity

Cell culture conditions were changed to a  CO2-free incuba-
tor and culture medium pH increased from pH 6.5 to pH 8.5 
in 1.0 increments using HCl and NaOH titration. After 48 
hour exposure to altered pH conditions, THP-1 macrophages 
were labeled in 100 μL/million cells in eBioscience™ Flow 
Cytometry Staining Buffer (Thermo Fisher) with 0.1 μL 
Zombie Aqua™ (BioLegend, San Diego, CA), 2 μL Bril-
liant Violet 421™ anti-CD-80 antibody (BioLegend, Cat# 
305222), 1 μL APC anti-CD-206 (MMR) antibody (BioLe-
gend Cat# 321110), and 5 μL FITC anti-CD-14 antibody 
(Abcam Cat# ab28061) prior to fixation and staining using 
commercial staining and fixation buffers (Thermo Fisher). 
Positive controls were created by culturing differentiated 
THP-1 macrophages in 20 ng/mL interferon gamma (IFN-
γ) and 1 ng/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for anti-CD-80 

and anti-CD-14 and in 20 ng/mL interleukin-4 (IL-4) and 
20 ng/mL interleukin-13 (IL-13) for anti-CD-206 in a 5% 
 CO2 incubator at pH 7.4 for 48 hours. Samples were ana-
lyzed using a FACSAria Fusion (BD Biosciences, San Jose, 
CA). 10,000 single-cell events were acquired for samples 
from each treatment group. Samples were gated for live 
singlet macrophages that were positive for CD14 and the 
results analyzed using FlowJo v.10 software (BD, Franklin 
Lakes, NJ)

Altered pH Treatment in an Ex Vivo Liver Model

Tissue Procurement and Assurances

Porcine liver was obtained immediately following excision 
from a USDA-approved abattoir and divided into 10 × 5 × 
3 cm sections to create the geometrical domains required. 
Tissue collection was deemed exempt from Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee review.

delivery. An ECM 830 Square Wave Electroporator was 
employed to deliver IRE pulses using a bipolar needle elec-
trode placed in the center of the liver sample at a depth of 
4 cm. During IRE delivery current and voltage readings 
were collected using a wideband current monitor connected 
to a Wavesurfer 3024z oscilloscope.

For tissue subject to IRE + CER, a bipolar needle elec-
trode was connected so that the anode and cathode were 
both initially on the needle electrode (Fig. 1a). Pulse deliv-
ery consisted of 100 pulses of 100 μs in length at 1000 V. 
Immediately after pulse delivery both electrodes on the nee-
dle were connected to the cathode and a ground electrode

pulses, 10 ms in length at 250 V, delivered with a measured 
current of 2.5 A [taken from the average of first and last 
pulse]).

pH Measurement in Liver

Immediately following pulse delivery, tissue was sectioned 
longitudinal to the path of electrode insertion and sequential 
pH measurements were collected in 2 mm increments from 
the center point of the electrode tip (Fig. 1c). To ensure rapid 
data collection, measurements were considered symmetri-
cal along each axis and both electrodes were considered as 
replicates of each other. The pH was also measured at a 
single point 8 mm radially from the center of the ablation 
every 15 minutes until the pH reached 6.4 (equal to untreated 
region). pH measurements were made using an Orion™ 
8103BNUWP ROSS Ultra™ pH Electrode (ThermoFisher 
Scientific).

Statistical Analysis

An  ordinary  one-way  ANOVA  and  post  hoc  Tukey’s 
multi-comparison test was used to analyze differences in 
macrophage  viability  and  activation  and  effect  of  pulse 
length on pH. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to 
analyze effect of increased current and voltage on pH. A 
p-value < 0.05 was considered significant.

in Agarose Phantoms

Application of IRE pulse delivery led to rapid, reproducible 
changes in pH detected using bromothymol blue (yellow 
(acidic pH), green (neutral pH), blue (basic pH)) (Fig. 2a). 
Increasing the current in the setting of a constant voltage 
led to an increased area of pH change with a maximum pH 
change at a current of 0.85 A (Fig. 2b,  r2 = 0.9240, N = 14, 
p < 0.0001). Conversely, stepwise increases in voltage in 
the setting of constant current failed to alter the area of pH 
change (Fig. 2c,  r2 = 0.065, N = 23, p = 0.2401). Changes in 
pulse length at a constant voltage and current led to sequen-
tial increases in area of pH change with a maximal change 
being detected at a 1 s pulse length (Fig. 2d, p < 0.0001 
between all groups).

Using a dual electrode arrangement (100 μs pulse length, 
1000 V) resulted in distinct, localized pH changes with the 
pH adjacent to the anode becoming more acidic (yellow) 
and the pH around the cathode becoming more basic (blue) 
(Fig. 3a). Using a 3-electrode arrangement and cycling the 
cathode-anode arrangement (100 μs pulse length, 1000 V) 
resulted  in  less  clear  changes  in  pH  compared  to  the  2 
electrode arrangement (Fig. 3b), whereas the 4 electrode 
arrangement resulted in 2 regions of increased pH and 2 
regions of decreased pH, albeit with smaller regions of pH 
change compared to the 2 electrode arrangement (Fig. 3c). 
Altering  the  pulse  delivery  parameter  to  increase  pulse 
length (1 s) at a lower voltage (10 V) led to an increased 
area of pH change for all electrode arrangements employed 
(Fig. 3d–f). When changing the design to incorporate a 
grounding electrode to serve as the anode, pulse delivery 
(1 s, 10 V) led to sustained pH increases around the elec-
trodes for all arrangements employed (Fig. 3g–i).

Effect of pH on Macrophage Viability and Activation

After gating for live-dead cells, macrophage (THP-1) cell 
population purity was confirmed (CD14 staining) (Fig. 4a). 
Increasing culture medium to pH > 8.5 led to decreased 
THP-1 cell viability (Fig. 4b, n = 6 independent experi-
ments, p < 0.01 pH 9.5  versus all other pH levels tested) 
and an increased percentage of THP-1 cells staining positive 
for CD206 (tumor-associated macrophage marker) (Fig. 4c, 
n = 6 independent experiments,  p < 0.0001 pH 8.5  versus 
pH 7.5 and pH 6.5) and CD80 (marker of M1 activation) 
(Fig. 4d, n = 6 independent experiments, p < 0.0001 pH 8.5 
versus pH 7.5 and pH 6.5), albeit with a higher percentage 
of cells staining for CD206 than CD80 at pH 8.5 (Fig. 4c 
and d).

ablations were readily detectable in ex vivo porcine liver 
tissue following pulse delivery (100 pulses, 100 μs length, 
1000 V + 400 pulses, 10 ms length, 250 V) (Fig. 5a). Meas-
urement of tissue pH immediately following IRE + CER 
delivery using tissue sectioning demonstrated pH remained 
significantly elevated up to 12 mm from the center of each 
needle electrode in the x- and y-planes (Fig. 5b and Table 1).

Discussion

The pH of the TME differs from that of nontumor tissue 
due  to  altered  tumor  metabolic  activity,  and  changes  in 
TME pH can function to alter tumoral immune responses. 
Electroporation-based ablation therapies (IRE) are growing 
in popularity and initiate a robust immune response follow-
ing treatment.44 To date, the electrochemical effects arising 
from IRE have largely been considered incidental (outside 
of electrolytic electroporation). Data presented herein dem-
onstrates it is possible to control pH to a physiologically rel-
evant magnitude in a sizeable area for a sustained amount of 
time by modulating IRE pulse delivery approaches in model 
systems.

Using agar phantoms with differing NaCl content to pro-
duce constant current demonstrated, that even as voltage 
increased by as much as 50-fold, pH remained unchanged. 
Conversely,  when  voltage  was  maintained  and  current 
altered in the same experimental system, a correlation of 
current to pH was detected in a manner similar to that previ-
ously reported,21 as well as a correlation of pulse width to 
pH. Current and pulse width can be described by the charge 
equation, where Q is charge, I is current, 𝜏 is pulse length, 

53

and N is pulse number. Charge dictates the total amount of 
electrons delivered or removed from the system, and these 
electrons drive the electrochemical reactions at the elec-
trode and tissue interface. At the cathode, water is reduced 
to hydrogen gas and produces hydroxide ions, ultimately 
increasing the tissue’s pH. Conversely, at the anode water 
is  oxidized  to  oxygen  gas  and  produces  hydrogen  ions, 
decreasing the local pH. Our data, in agreement with exist-
ing literature, indicates the pH change during IRE delivery 
is proportional to the total charge delivered.
ΔpH ∝ Q = I ∗ 𝜏 ∗ N

From a practical perspective, when using IRE clini-
cally these data are relevant since the two most commonly 
altered pulse delivery parameters are voltage and pulse 
width. These data from a model system suggest that to suc-
cessfully manipulate tissue pH within the ablation focus 
should be directed toward pulsing paradigms designed to 
deliver lower voltage pulses of longer duration. Addition-
ally, previous studies report that these types of pulse deliv-
eries have the added advantage of the diminished potential 
for nerve excitation and thermal damage.5 Similar to the 
pH change, neuromuscular stimulation is weakly depend-
ent on current and pulse width. However, an important 
distinction is that the neuromuscular stimulation is pri-
marily dependent on the pulse amplitude, whereas the pH 
change is dependent on the current amplitude, pulse width, 
and the number of pulses. Therefore, we speculate the use 
of high frequency (i.e., very short duration) monophasic 
pulses, delivered in a high number over time, could combat 
neuromuscular stimulation without sacrificing pH change.
An important consideration when performing in situ tis-
sue ablation is the ability to accurately predict the ablation 
zone in vivo. Previous studies using commercial IRE sys-
tems report the ablation size and shape depend on both the 
pulse parameters delivered and the number/arrangement of 
the electrodes used. In the simplest case this involves plac-
ing electrodes in parallel on either side of the target lesion. 
However, by increasing the number of electrodes used, the 
possibility  arises  to  alter  both  the  positioning  in  and/or 
around the target and the sequence in which the pulses are 
delivered between the respective electrodes. When modeling 
this approach using agar phantoms we demonstrated that 
when using 2 parallel electrodes a balance of acidic and 
alkaline pH changes occurs between the anode and cathode. 
To address this imbalance in pH change and create a uniform 
pH change we connect multiple electrodes to the cathode ter-
minal within the target region in conjunction with a separate 
anode of much greater surface area relative to the cathodes. 
This allows for sustainable changes in pH in the targeted 
region in conjunction with minimal changes in pH at the 
larger anode. Such an effect is explainable using Kirchhoff’s

circuit laws which states the current entering the domain 
must equal the current exiting the region. Thus, it should 
be possible to manipulate both the size and shape of the pH 
change region by altering the number or the geometry of 
the electrodes within the target region when using a distant 
surface electrode.

In considering such an approach in vivo, the effect of 
DC pulses on neuromuscular activity should be closely 
monitored as electrical current will flow through skeletal 
muscle and neurons to the grounding pad raising the pos-
sibility of muscle twitch/spasm. In the simplest translation 
to the clinic, this treatment requires minimal additional 
work from the surgical team. A bipolar needle electrode 
can be left in situ following IRE, and a surface electrode, 
connected to the anode, will be fastened to the patient 
before CER treatment is delivered through the needle elec-
trode. Importantly, the tissue in proximity to the anode 
will be exposed to acidic reactions. While we expect this 
change to be minimal in comparison to the pH change at 
cathode, the use of inert electrode materials and electrode 
coatings can further mitigate acidosis.12 Also, the surface 
in contact with the grounding pad could be primed with 
an alkaline gel to offset the acidosis. Along with these 
methods to mitigate incidental pH changes, the data in 
Fig. 4b suggests we will not have significant loss in via-
bility within this range. However, the data are limited to 
macrophages, so further investigations are needed for the 
effect of a pH change on liver cells and tissue.

In developing approaches to alter the TME pH to acti-
vate anti-tumor immune responses, there is an inherent need 
to identify an optimal target pH to do so. In this study we 
employed an in vitro macrophage (THP-1 cells) model by 
activating M0 (uncommitted) monocytes using PMA (which 
differentiates the cells into macrophages). However, these 
cells remain plastic and can maintain polarization (M1) or 
re-polarize (M2) based on changes in the milieu of inflam-
matory mediators and cell culture conditions (i.e., IFN- γ 
and LPS for M1; IL-4 and IL-13 for M2). Once the M1/M2 
state was confirmed (FACS), a pH of ≥ 8.5 was more effec-
tive than lower pH (neutral or acidic) in polarizing M0 mac-
rophages. Specifically, we identify that CD206 expression 
increases as the alkalinity of culture medium rises. However, 
while CD206 is usually considered a tumor-associated mac-
rophage (TAM) marker, it can also indicate an anti-tumor 
response.15,23 This was confirmed in our model system by a 
parallel increase in CD80 expression as pH increased.24,40 
While care should be taken in interpreting these in vitro 
data relative to the more complex in vivo environment, it is 
tempting to speculate that the changes in polarity induced 
by elevating pH could impact resident TAMs and mono-
cytes entering the TME by extravasation. Equally, detailed 
in vitro and in vivo studies are required to fully evaluate 

the effect of changes in pH on M1 versus M2 transition in 
macrophages.10

Unlike thermal ablation, in which ex vivo tissue ablations 
closely mimic those achieved in vivo,27 the dynamic cell 
death processes induced following IRE delivery can only 
be fully modeled in vivo. However, perfused and nonper-
fused tissues have been employed to demonstrate “proof 
of concept” to model in vivo efficacy.29,30 As previously 
reported use of a dual electrode – single needle IRE deliv-
ery device results in a peanut shaped ablation due to the 
bipolar electrode geometry in which the effects of IRE are 
more pronounced at the electrodes compared to the insula-
tion between them 17. The center, darker region immedi-
ately adjacent to the electrodes typically undergoes necrotic, 
thermal damage.38,39,45 Based on these previous studies, the 
extent of the IRE ablation should extend to the paler region, 
with the region beyond this experiencing reversible elec-
troporation. Based on our data, the pH treatment created a 
region of alkalinity along the transition zone between irre-
versible and reversible electroporation, which may prove 
beneficial if the anti-tumor immune response is enhanced 
by increasing pH as this region is the most likely site of 
incomplete ablation and local recurrence.28 Of further note, 
the initial pH of the excised liver in our study was 6.4, a pH 
that is similar to that reported in the TME, and the pH of the 
transition region took 7 hours post IRE + CER delivery to 
return to pH of 6.4. However, as previously highlighted, the 
maintenance of this pH change may be exaggerated in the 
absence of tissue perfusion and detailed in vivo analysis is 
required to determine the relevance to in vivo IRE ablation.
In considering and interpreting the data presented, several 
important limitations should be considered. Firstly, while 
the use of agar phantoms and ex vivo tissue provide critical 
preclinical data regarding the potential to manipulate the 
TME pH, this should be balanced against the anatomical and 
pathophysiological complexities associated with the TME 
in vivo. Although the ex vivo liver tissue provides a suitable 
domain for this initial study of the pH gradient, the use of a 
perfused liver model in a future study would provide insight 
to the spatial and temporal changes seen in vivo. Similarly, 
analyzing the effect of pH on macrophage phenotype pro-
vides promising preliminary data regarding the potential of 
inducing anti-tumor immune responses in the TME. How-
ever, we stress that many tumors (including hepatomas) 
arise in the setting of damaged or compromised non-tumor 
tissue in which the immune cell component can (and often 
is) profoundly different to that which exists in healthy tis-
sue.6,26,43 Finally, it is important to reiterate that, following 
IRE delivery, the ablation zone is a dynamic physiological 
environment in which numerous immunological and non-
immunological pathways (including programmed cell death) 
interact. Thus, to fully understand the impact of changing 

1 3tissue pH using IRE on ablation efficacy will require detailed 
in silico, ex vivo and in vivo experimental approaches.

A major limitation associated with cancer therapy is the 
TME which is overall immunosuppressive, in part due to its 
acidity. The preclinical data presented herein indicate that 
changing IRE ablation parameters can be utilized to increase 
regional pH changes within the post-IRE ablation zone. 
Given the role of pH on determining macrophage phenotype 
and the impact of macrophages and the immune response in 
tumor progression, these data suggest that modulating TME 
pH through electrolysis could function to complement IRE 
treatment by enhancing the anti-tumor immune response.

Abstract: Intermittent fasting is one of the most popular types of diet at the moment because it is an
effective nutritional strategy in terms of weight loss. The main objective of this review is to analyze
the effects that intermittent fasting has on sports performance. We analyzed physical capacities:
aerobic capacity, anaerobic capacity, strength, and power, as well as their effect on body composition.
For this, a bibliographic search was carried out in several databases where 25 research articles were
analyzed to clarify these objectives. Inclusion criteria: dates between 2013 and present, free full texts,
studies conducted in adult human athletes, English and/or Spanish languages, and if it has been
considered that intermittent fasting is mainly linked to sports practice and that this obtains a result in
terms of performance or physical capacities. This review was registered in PROSPERO with code
ref. 407024, and an evaluation of the quality or risk of bias was performed. After this analysis, results
were obtained regarding the improvement of body composition and the maintenance of muscle mass.
An influence of intermittent fasting on sports performance and body composition is observed. It
can be concluded that intermittent fasting provides benefits in terms of body composition without
reducing physical performance, maintenance of lean mass, and improvements in maximum power.
But despite this, it is necessary to carry out new studies focusing on the sports field since the samples
have been very varied. Additionally, the difference in hours of intermittent fasting should be studied,
especially in the case of overnight fasting.

Keywords: sport nutrition; athletic performance; fasting strategies; exercise

1. Introduction

The role that nutrition plays today in the sports performance of athletes is clear.
However, in recent years, different dietary patterns and protocols have emerged that
have tried to amplify or reduce the adaptations derived from physical exercise to try to
achieve an improvement in the athlete’s sports performance [1–3]. Within these strategies,
intermittent fasting has been acquiring special renewed interest due to its supposed effects
on health and improvement of body composition in patients with different pathologies of
great predominance nowadays. Intermittent fasting is a popular type of dietary pattern
based on timed periods of fasting. This dietary protocol focuses on timed fasting/eating
periods with different time intervals [4,5].

Despite this recent popularity, currently, its effects on performance do not seem to
be clarified. This has special importance in the physical and cognitive performance of
those athletes who frequently perform this type of dietary pattern or temporary caloric
restrictions, as happens with Islamic athletes during the religious practice of Ramadan [5–7].
Therefore, the main objective of the present review was to investigate whether intermittent
fasting intervenes in performance in professional athletes, evaluating the effects of this
dietary intervention on aerobic and anaerobic capacity, strength and power, and body com-
position such as fat mass, muscle mass, and weight, which could affect sports performance.
The study will focus on research findings regarding intermittent fasting.

2. Materials and Methods

This work is a systematized literature review based on scientific evidence documenting
the effects of intermittent fasting in athletes and/or people who perform physical activity
and its benefits on sports performance. This review was carried out in 2022 and registered
in PROSPERO with code ref. 407024, and an evaluation of the quality or risk of bias
assessment was performed by J.C.-P using the blinded Cochrane risk of bias tool.

For the literature review, the following databases were used: MEDLINE through the
PubMed search engine, Web of Science (WOS), and Scopus. The keywords used were:
“intermittent fasting”, “sport”, “performance”, and “exercise” where 4402 articles were
obtained using Boolean connectors “or” between the words in different languages and “and”
between the different ones (“intermittent fasting” OR “intermittent fasting” AND “sport”
OR “sport” AND “performance” OR “performance” AND “exercise” OR “exercise”). The
inclusion criteria that have been established are the following: dates established between
2013 and the present, due to the importance that is beginning to be given to intermittent
fasting studies from this year onwards; free full texts; studies conducted in adult human
athletes; languages of the articles in English and/or Spanish; it has been considered that
intermittent fasting is mainly linked to sports practice and that this obtains a result in terms
of performance or physical capacities. The exclusion criteria of the articles are the following:
dates established after 2013, texts not available, and languages of the articles being other
than English and/or Spanish.

Therefore, when filtering articles from 2013 to today, focusing on humans and adults
and limiting the languages to Spanish and English, 114 articles were found. After elimi-
nating duplicates, we obtained 92 papers. Once the titles were read, 34 were selected and
58 were eliminated because the title was not related to the topic of the systematic review.
After reading the abstracts and observing the bibliographies, 12 articles were eliminated,
but 3 were added from the bibliographies obtained by complete readings. This whole
procedure was followed according to PRISMA standards [8], by means of which a flow
chart was made (Figure 1). No deviation from these standards was found.

3. Results

Within the bibliography of this review, we found that the majority highlighted that
the subjects were athletes [9–20]. Another did not specify if they were athletes [21], but
due to their intervention, it was included, while the rest indicated that the subjects were
physically active [22–26].

Most of them showed time-restricted feeding (TRF) with a 16 h fasting window and
8 h feeding window [9–12,14,16,19,22–24,27]. Other studies analyzed 14/8 fasting during
the Ramadan period [12,18,28], while another article analyzed overnight fasting [15].

In addition to this, it should be noted that two studies used more variables in their
studies, such as the intake of supplementation in addition to the fasting follow-up, namely
hydroxy methyl butyrate (HMB) and two types of whey protein: whey protein concentrate
(WPC) and hydrolyzed whey protein (WPH) [24,29]. Another article sought to compare
the difference between protein-loaded and carbohydrate-loaded fasting [20]. For the most
part, a control group with no fasting and an experimental group performing fasting are
identified [23].

Data are shown in Table 1, based on performance, specifically aerobic performance,
eight articles were included that used different tests, among them: 20 min cycling test [29],
10 km test [11], repeated sprints test [15,26], treadmill test [16], and test at 45% of maximum
power [9]. Regarding anaerobic performance, six articles used different tests to evaluate
different parameters of the sample such as stress tests [9,11], Wingate test [22,26,29], sub-
maximal exercise [20], repeated sprints test [26], and interval training [20]. Regarding
muscular strength and power, eight included studies that evaluated muscular strength
through maximal strength and endurance strength tests and power through peak power
(PPO) and average power (W) [10,14,18,19,24–27]. Finally, regarding body composition
and health, we included the 15 studies that evaluated any body composition variable such
as body fat mass, lean mass, and anthropometric folds [9–11,14,16–19,21,23–25,28,30–33].

4. Discussion

To begin with, we must consider that there is a wide variety of studies chosen in the
review in terms of the difference of sports in the sample, the differences in gender and age,
and the different interventions.

Firstly, we can affirm that intermittent fasting (any type) metabolically affects the body
composition [9–12,14,23–27]. With this, we can concretize that it intervenes positively in
performance since a reduction in body weight would be considered beneficial [9,11,25].

Intermittent fasting could be considered an adequate nutritional strategy to reduce
body fat percentage to an adequate number for the athlete (between 6 and 12% in men
and between 12 and 18% in women) and maintain lean mass or muscle mass [1,2,7,28].
A study published in 2021 with 14 active women who combined TRF with high-intensity
training (HIIT) compared to HIIT with a normal diet observed a significant decrease in fat
in the fasting group. It should be noted that the food log showed a non-voluntary caloric
restriction of 10–20% per week [25]. A study with 50 healthy subjects combining a fasting
intervention together with the performance of physical activity [28] observed a decrease in
body mass index and body fat percentage.

It should be clarified that the effectiveness of the intermittent fasting protocols included
in this review is closely linked to the time of application and to the type of population.
Fasting is more effective in the medium and long term than in the short term [22,25],
which raises the importance of adherence to treatment with this protocol. In turn, we
should consider that in some studies [14,16,23–25] caloric restriction is combined with
the follow-up of intermittent fasting. This aspect highlights conclusions obtained from
recent studies where no superiority of different dietary protocols is observed, including
intermittent fasting, if an adequate caloric deficit and a correct adherence to the dietary plan
are reached [34,35]. Therefore, the effect of caloric restriction is a very important element to
consider in relation to the reduction of fat mass.

Despite this, other studies show a greater adherence to the diet in those subjects
who followed a nutritional plan with intermittent fasting compared to a diet without
restrictions [23]. This aspect could be interesting considering the important role of a higher
adherence for the adequacy of long-term fat loss and the need for individualization of the
same [36].

Considering health in conjunction with intermittent fasting, a review published in
2022 points out that fasting controls body weight, improves insulin sensitivity, reduces
systemic inflation, and strengthens the immune system [12]. Thus, it can be linked to injury
prevention and recovery. Several reviews mention the benefits of intermittent fasting in
improving metabolic health and insulin sensitivity [30], as well as in regulating glucose and
certain lipid metabolism [32]. Certain metabolic processes in adipose tissue are mediated
by endogenous clocks in our body such as adiponectin, the levels of this hormone can be
altered by changes in sleep/wake or feeding/fasting cycles [32]. The TRF type of fasting
appears to be an effective strategy to improve the levels of this hormone. Thirty-four men
habituated to resistance training [10] found an increase in adiponectin levels and a decrease
in leptin levels. The same author in another study with 16 cyclists [9] observed a trend of
higher increase in adiponectin levels in the TRF group (+33%) compared to (+8%) in the
normal diet group. Low levels of adiponectin have been associated with obesity, oxidative
stress [10], and insulin resistance, whereas higher levels are associated with improved
insulin sensitivity in adipose tissue [32].

This improvement in the treatment of different diseases has also been contrasted by
other trials [37,38]. However, recent reviews show the need for long-term studies evaluating
this type of intervention versus isocaloric restriction in humans to know whether the results
may be different from those observed after similar weight loss achieved through modest
continuous energy restriction [39–41].

With respect to the levels of certain inflammatory markers, some studies hypothesize
that intermittent fasting may activate cellular mechanisms that enhance immune function [4].
In a group of elite cyclists, interleukin (IL-6) appeared to decrease in the TRF group with an

Nutrients 2024, 16, 168

11 of 14

upward trend in the normal diet group [9]. Also, in this same study, he observed a decrease
in the neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in both groups, but it was significant relative to
baseline values only in the TRF group. NLR is a biomarker of systemic inflammation that
correlates with blood C-reactive protein levels, which were found to be decreased during
Ramadan fasting in two studies of football players [17].

Finally, in terms of performance, we found both positive and negative aspects. It
seems that during Ramadan (14/10), negative effects appear in terms of performance,
which may be due to other aspects such as rest and hydration. Greater negative effects can
be observed in elite athletes, but in amateur athletes, there is not much difference [12,18,19].
On the other hand, in the TRF modality (16/8), there do not seem to be differences in the
performance of physical capacities: aerobic [9,11,13,16,27,29], anaerobic [11,13,19,26,29],
and strength and power [10,12,14,19,20,22,24,27,29]. The results of this review thus show
that, in terms of capacities, intermittent fasting does not have a negative impact on sports
performance and could be considered an adequate type of diet for sports practice.

Recent reviews have also highlighted these varied findings, stressing the need for
more research in this regard given the wide heterogeneity of protocols and measurable
variables [19,42].

Nevertheless, the possible effect of this type of intervention on the athlete’s body
composition and, therefore, its possible link with the athlete’s performance, should be
considered [27,29].

Finally, the possible limitations observed during the elaboration of the work are
presented, and due to these, it is not possible to obtain accurate conclusions. The review
has had little variety of interventions, which does not allow us to identify a specific action
protocol. The samples, tests, measurements, objectives, and variables of the different studies
have also been a limitation. Some of them did not count calories during the interventions
and because of this we cannot obtain a reliable conclusion about the results obtained, or
in the case of the variables, not all the studies measured the same ones, so we cannot
draw reliable conclusions in their entirety. Many of the articles look for short-term effects
when it has been concluded that long- and medium-term effects are more effective. Most
of the studies conclude that a follow-up of future interventions is necessary to continue
monitoring the effects of fasting, so there seems to be a lack of evidence in the studies. Also,
the difference in hours of intermittent fasting should be studied, especially in the case of
overnight fasting. The diversity of the studies analyzed must be taken into account, which
may affect the generalizability of the conclusions.

5. Conclusions

After carrying out this systematic review of the studies and the literature on how
intermittent fasting affects athletes and sports performance, the questions and objectives
posed at the beginning of the study can be answered. Referring to the main objective,
the scientific evidence indicates that intermittent fasting does not negatively affect sports
performance and does affect the improvement of body composition. Therefore, it may be
an appropriate strategy for sports or athletes seeking control of lean mass and a decrease in
fat mass, which can have a positive transfer in terms of performance, since by reducing
their weight and specifically their fat mass they will be able to perform better in certain
situations in which power capacity is used.

The performance of the aerobic capacity would be improved since the improvement
of the corporal composition can help to the improvement of the resistance; this fact ends
in an improvement of the power being related directly with the corporal weight. As far
as strength is concerned, it is not compromised by intermittent fasting and remains at the
same level. Intermittent fasting would be related to an increase or improvement of health
and the immune system; this is also related to performance as it improves the ability to
prevent injuries and promote recovery. Further studies would be needed to be more certain
about the effects of intermittent fasting on sports performance. The heterogeneous samples

Nutrients 2024, 16, 168

12 of 14

make it difficult to have a definitive conclusion, but the data are favorable, and it could be
recommended to follow intermittent fasting without reducing performance in athletes.

The case of Ramadan is different:

it can be considered as a type of intermittent
fasting/TRF in which the fasting period varies between 12 and 18 h depending on the
season and location, unlike the other types of TRF, the restriction on the intake of any
type of liquid and the fasting time lasts from sunrise to sunset. This causes disturbance
in the sleep/wake and rest/activity cycles. Due to changes in sleeping and eating hours,
physiological and psychological disturbances can be caused. There is evidence showing
that fasting during Ramadan affects a decrease in performance in the YO-YO test, which
measures VO2 max [22].

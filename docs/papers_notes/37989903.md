- Inverse finite element analysis (iFEA) of the atrioventricular heart valves (AHVs) can provide insights into the in-vivo valvular function, such as in-vivo tissue …
- In this exploratory study, we propose the use of Bayesian optimization (BO) to study the AHV functional behaviors in-vivo.
- We analyzed the efficacy of Bayesian optimization to estimate the isotropic Lee-Sacks material coefficients in three benchmark problems: (i) an inflation test, (ii) a …
- Then, we applied the developed BO-iFEA framework to predict the leaflet properties for a patient-specific tricuspid valve under a congenital heart defect condition.
- We found that the BO could accurately construct the objective function surface compared to the one from a [Formula: see text] grid search analysis.
- Additionally, in all cases the proposed BO-iFEA framework yielded material parameter predictions with average element errors less than 0.02 mm/mm (normalized by the …
- Nonetheless, the solutions were not unique due to the presence of a long-valley minima region in the objective function surfaces.
- Parameter sets along this valley can yield functionally equivalent outcomes (i.e., closing behavior) and are typically observed in the inverse analysis or parameter …

- <h4>Background</h4>Although the serrated-neoplasia pathway reportedly accounts for 15-30% of colorectal cancer (CRC), no studies on chemoprevention of sessile serrated …
- We searched for effective compounds comprehensively from a large series of compounds by employing Connectivity Map (CMAP) analysis of SSL-specific gene expression …
- We evaluated their inhibitory effects on SSL-PDOs using a cell viability assay.
- SSL-PDOs were orthotopically transplanted into NOG mice for in vivo evaluation.
- The signal transduction pathway was evaluated by gene expression profile and protein expression analysis.<h4>Results</h4>We identified 221 compounds by employing CMAP …
- Cell viability assay using SSL-PDOs identified lansoprazole as having the lowest IC50 value (47 µM) among 17 compounds.
- When SSL-PDO was orthotopically transplanted into murine intestinal tract, the tumor grew gradually.
- Administration of lansoprazole to mice inhibited the growth of SSL xenograft whereas the tumor in control mice treated with vehicle alone grew gradually over time.

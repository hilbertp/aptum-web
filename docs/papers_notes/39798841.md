- <h4>Background</h4>Surgical techniques for biceps tenodesis vary in approach, fixation strategy, and anatomic location without a clear superior technique for this common procedure.
- The purpose of this study was to prospectively evaluate a randomized cohort of patients who underwent arthroscopic suprapectoral biceps tenodesis (ASBT) with …
- mini-open subpectoral biceps tenodesis (MOBT) with a unicortical button implant using an onlay technique with regard to (1) clinical outcome measures and (2) structural …
- American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and visual analog scale scores were recorded at baseline, 3 months, and 2 years postoperatively.
- The integrity of the biceps tendon at the tenodesis site was independently examined via ultrasound by a musculoskeletal-trained radiologist at 3 months and 2 years postoperatively.
- t tests were performed for continuous variables, whereas χ<sup>2</sup> tests were performed for categorical variables.<h4>Results</h4>A total of 52 patients (24 ASBT and …
- At baseline, 3 months, and 2 years postoperatively, the mean American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons, Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation, and Visual Analog Scale scores …
- At the 3-month postoperative ultrasound, 23 of 24 (96%) ASBT patients and 26 of 28 (93%) MOBT patients were noted to have a clearly intact biceps tenodesis.

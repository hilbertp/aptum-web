- <h4>Background</h4>To explore the application of a new three-dimensional computed tomography measurement (maximum-inscribed-sphere method) in female DDH (developmental …
- The pelvis types were classified as gynecoid (11 patients) and anthropoid (8 patients).
- The maximum-inscribed-sphere method was applied to measure the bony birth canal.
- The lateral central edge angle (LCE), the anterior central edge angle (ACE), the Tönnis angle, and the distance between the femoral head and Koher's line were …
- In anthropoid patients, the narrowest part of the bony birth canal was found at the 21st layer before surgery (105.89 mm ± 6.58 mm), and the 19th layer after surgery …
- The most statistically significant narrowing was found at the 8th layer (4.25 mm ± 3.51 mm p < 0.05) in those with gynecoid type pelvis, and at the 9th layer (5.8 mm ± …
- There was no statistical statistically significant difference between acetabular dysplasia and bony birth canal in the two type groups before surgery.
- For the anthropoid type, the increment of LCE angle and the narrowing of bony birth canal from the 13th to 19th layer after PAO was also more statistically significant.

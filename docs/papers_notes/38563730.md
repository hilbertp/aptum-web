- We report a CO-free approach to indole-2-carboxylic esters: rhodium-catalysed C(2)-alkoxycarbonylation of indoles with 2,4,6-trimethylbenzoic acid-based carbonate anhydrides.
- Selective C-O bond cleavage of the anhydrides facilitates the introduction of various alkoxycarbonyl groups.
- Control experiments suggest that merging a rhodium catalyst and KI promotes the <i>in situ</i> formation of the RhI species.

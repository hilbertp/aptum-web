- <h4>Background</h4>Although China has achieved malaria elimination, the risk of reintroduction persists due to imported Plasmodium falciparum cases.
- Occasional infections without a clear travel history present challenge to routine epidemiological investigation and underscore the need for advanced tracing …
- falciparum case reported in Chongqing, China, in 2019.
- The patient had no overseas travel history but was treated at the same hospital with a confirmed imported case from the Democratic Republic of the Congo …
- IBD analysis showed a high degree of relatedness (IBD = 0.9) between this case and the DRC-imported case, suggesting a potential transmission link.
- These findings indicate the likely Central African origin of the infection and raise concerns about local transmission risk even in a post-elimination …
- Genomic epidemiology enables finer-scale resolution of parasite origin and relatedness, providing critical evidence in elimination-phase malaria …
- Their integration supports elimination-stage strategies and helps prevent malaria reintroduction in formerly endemic regions.

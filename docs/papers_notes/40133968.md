- <h4>Background</h4>This study compared the accuracy of three generalized approaches for estimating proximity to failure during the Smith machine bench press: (i) the …
- Their 1-repetition maximum (1RM = 86.8 ± 16.7 kg) was determined during the first session.
- In the second session, people performed single sets to failure at 60% and 80% 1RM, with proximity to failure (2RIR and 4RIR) estimated using each …
- In contrast, both the %1RM-RTF and RTF-velocity relationships overestimated the intended RIR at 60%1RM for both 2RIR (2.9 and 5.8 repetitions, respectively) and 4RIR …
- The RIR-velocity relationship generally demonstrated the lowest absolute errors compared to the actual RIR (1.3 ± 0.7 repetitions), with greater differences compared to …

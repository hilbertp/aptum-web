- Cactin, a highly conserved protein, plays a crucial role in various physiological processes in eukaryotes, including innate immunity.
- Recently, the function of Cactin in the innate immunity of <i>Drosophila</i> has been explored, revealing that Cactin regulates a non-canonical signaling pathway …
- In addition, Cactin exhibits specific antiviral activity against the <i>Drosophila</i> C virus (DCV) in <i>Drosophila</i>, with an unknown mechanism.
- During DCV infection, it has been confirmed that the protein level and antiviral activity of Cactin are regulated by ubiquitination.
- However, the precise ubiquitination and deubiquitination mechanisms of Cactin in <i>Drosophila</i> remain unexplored.
- In this study, we identified ubiquitin-specific protease 14 (Usp14) as a major deubiquitinase for Cactin through comprehensive deubiquitinase screening.
- Our results demonstrate that Usp14 interacts with the C_Cactus domain of Cactin <i>via</i> its USP domain.
- Usp14 efficiently removes K48- and K63-linked polyubiquitin chains from Cactin, thereby preventing its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.

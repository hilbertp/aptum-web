- Incidental durotomies are frequent complications of spine surgery associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak-related symptoms.
- Management typically involves prolonged bed rest to reduce CSF pressure at the durotomy site.
- However, early ambulation may be a safer, effective alternative.
- PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, and Scopus were systematically searched for studies comparing early ambulation (bed rest ≤ 24 h) with prolonged bed rest (> 24 …
- The outcomes of interest were CSF leak, hypotensive headache, additional surgical repair, pseudomeningocele, and pulmonary complications.
- Systematic reviews and meta-analysis were performed following the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
- We included a total of 704 patients from 6 studies.
- There was a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of pulmonary complications (RR 0.23; 95% CI 0.08-0.67; p = 0.007) in the early mobilization group.

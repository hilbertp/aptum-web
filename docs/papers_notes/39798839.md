- <h4>Background</h4>Heterotopic ossification (HO) of the elbow resulting in limited motion is a relatively uncommon condition often caused by burns, trauma, and central …
- This retrospective study presents the long-term outcomes of 51 cases of elbow HO treated with surgical excision and regimented postoperative rehabilitation …
- All procedures were performed in the inpatient setting at an Academic Level I Trauma Center between September 1999 and August 2022 by fellowship-trained upper extremity surgeons.
- Patient demographics and case characteristics such as age, gender, mechanism of injury, and comorbidities were collected for comparison.
- Long-term follow-up examinations were elbow flexion-extension arcs, prono-supination arcs, Visual Analog Scale pain scores, and Mayo Elbow Performance …
- The median flexion-extension arc at final follow-up was 110° (95°-130°), which was maintained at 85% of the intraoperative arc achieved.
- Prono-supination arc at final follow-up was 170° (105°-180°), which was maintained at 97% of intraoperative levels.
- The median reported Mayo Elbow Performance Score and Visual Analog Scale score were 80 (70-93) and 2 (0-4), respectively.

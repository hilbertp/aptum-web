- Uninterrupted monitoring of fetal cardiac health is essential for the timely diagnosis of congenital diseases.
- The maternal Electrocardiogram (mECG), which has the most statistically significant impact, always tampers with the signals collected from the pregnant woman's abdomen.
- So, an efficient nonlinear filtering network based on artificial neural network (ANN) is required to eliminate the maternal part from the abdominal Electrocardiogram …
- In this work, we have presented an adaptive noise canceler (ANC) using 3-layer perceptron architecture where the inputs are expanded by the functional link expansion …
- The adaptive filter approximates the nonlinear mapping between the thoracic Electrocardiogram (tECG) and the maternal component present in the aECG.
- Here the thoracic signal is the reference signal, and the abdominal signal is the desired signal to the adaptive filter.
- The proposed methodology uses the advantages of both multilayer perceptron (MLP) as well as functional link neural network (FLNN) in mapping the nonlinearity and …
- For the detailed analysis, we have used the real Daisy database, the Non-invasive Fetal ECG database, and the fetal ECG synthetic database from Physionet.

- High-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (hr-cSCC) tumors exhibit aggressive behavior, leading to local recurrence, metastasis, and mortality.
- The management of hr-cSCC tumors is not well-defined.
- To clarify the impact of clinical risk factors and management strategies on disease-related outcomes (DROs) in patients with hr-cSCCs.
- This dual-center retrospective cohort study reviewed patient records from 2007 to 2023, focusing on hr-cSCC tumors classified as high-risk according to two staging systems.
- 160 adult patients with hr-cSCC were included.
- Tumors > 2 cm were associated with a higher risk of recurrence, metastasis, and mortality, with greater risk for tumors > 4 cm.
- Nonsurgical therapies were linked to higher recurrence and mortality rates compared to surgical monotherapy.
- Patients whose initial treatment was delayed > 60 days following biopsy had increased incidence of DROs.

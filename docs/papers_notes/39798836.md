- Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex neuropsychiatric disorder potentially influenced by factors such as stress and inflammation.
- Chronic stress can lead to maladaptive brain changes that may trigger immune hyperactivation, contributing to MDD's pathogenesis.
- While the involvement of inflammation in MDD is well established, the effects of inflammatory preconditioning in animals subsequently exposed to chronic stress remain unclear.
- This study aimed to investigate the impact of inflammatory preconditioning on behavioral, biochemical, and molecular changes in adult male Swiss mice subjected to …
- The mice received a single injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 24 h before thefirst CRS and performed 6 h daily for 28 days.
- Behavioral tests were conducted 24 h after the last CRS, across 4 days, and euthanasia followed 24 h after the final tests.
- Results indicated that only the LPS + CRS group exhibited depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, accompanied by demotivation and apathy.
- Biochemical and molecular analyses revealed anoxidative imbalance in the hippocampus, marked by elevated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels and MPO activity.

- Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family member-associated NF-κB activator-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) plays a key role in the induction of the type 1 …
- Viruses target calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) signaling networks, which participate in the regulation of the viral life cycle, as well as mediate the host antiviral response.
- Although many studies have focused on the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the regulation of IFN-I, the relationship between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and TBK1 in different …
- Here, we examined the effects of the Newcastle disease virus (NDV)-induced increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels on the suppression of host antiviral responses.
- We demonstrated that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> increased statistically significantly during NDV infection, leading to impaired IFN-I production and antiviral …
- Depletion of Ca²<sup>+</sup> was found to lead to a statistically significant increase in virus-induced IFN-I production resulting in the inhibition of viral replication.
- Mechanistically, the accumulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to viral infection increases the phosphatase activity of CaN, which in turn dephosphorylates and …
- Furthermore, the inhibition of CaN on viral replication was counteracted in <i>TBK1</i> knockout cells.

- <h4>Objective</h4>In athlete monitoring, the use of subjective scales to assess training load is highly feasible and can serve as a valuable complement to objective method.
- However, the reliability and validity of subjective approaches remain unclear.
- This study investigated the relationship between session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE) and both internal and external training load (TL) in professional rowers …
- Additionally, it evaluated the reliability and validity of sRPE method in different training courses.
- The study hypothesizes that the sRPE method will exhibit high reliability and validity across different rowing training sessions, particularly in ergometer training, …
- We quantified TL using multiple metrics, including Banister's Training Impulse (BTRIMP), sRPE, and total weight lifted.
- The reliability and validity of the sRPE scale across different training of rowers were assessed by test-retest reliability and criterion-related validity …
- Notably, the strongest concurrent validity with BTRIMP was observed during ergometer training.

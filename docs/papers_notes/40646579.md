- Only circulating tumor cells (CTCs) that successfully evade immune surveillance upon entering the bloodstream can lead to clonal expansion and metastasis.
- Cancer progression is accompanied by pathophysiological processes such as platelet activation and thrombosis.
- Platelets secrete a variety of growth factors to stimulate cancer cell proliferation, regulate tumor angiogenesis, and subsequently mediate surface changes in cancer …
- As part of a dangerous alliance, CTCs and platelets induce mutual activation.
- Activated platelets aggregate and encapsulate tumor cells, forming microtumor thrombi containing fibrin clots that act as protective barriers.
- These platelets interact with immune cells, including NK cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and T cells, to facilitate cancer metastasis and progression through various mechanisms.
- The formation of a favorable tumor microenvironment (TME) and pre-metastatic niche aids cancer cells in evading immune surveillance.
- Multiple signaling pathways and immune checkpoints are also involved in this process.

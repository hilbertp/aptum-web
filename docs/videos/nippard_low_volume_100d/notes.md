- Defines working volume as the number of hard sets per muscle per week.
- Traditional recommendations often cite ~10–20 sets/week for hypertrophy; here the approach is roughly ~6 sets/week during a 100‑day cut.
- Effort is very high: sets are taken to near failure (low RIR), prioritizing compound lifts with consistent technique.
- Reported outcomes over the 100 days: fat mass decreased, strength was largely maintained, and lean mass was roughly stable with small fluctuations.
- Practical takeaway: during energy deficit, reducing volume while raising effort and lift quality can preserve muscle performance and recovery for trained lifters.
- Monitoring proximity to failure (RIR / bar velocity) helps ensure sufficient stimulus when volume is low.
- Exercise selection favors low‑redundancy movements that load target muscles efficiently; accessories are pared back.
- Recovery management (sleep, protein sufficiency, and strategic deloads) is emphasized to keep performance stable while calories are low.
- Caveats: n=1 design, non‑controlled diet and measurement methods; results may not generalize to all muscles, sports, or long time frames.
- On maintenance or surplus phases, higher volumes may still be preferable for hypertrophy progression; low‑volume cutting is a situational strategy.
